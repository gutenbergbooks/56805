  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An earlier edition of <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span> having attracted the hearty approval
of a limited circle of that class of readers who prefer “a running
banquet that hath much variety, but little of a sort,” the present publisher
requested the preparation of an enlargement of the work. In
the augmented form in which it is now offered to the public, the contents
will be found so much more comprehensive and omnifarious
that, while it has been nearly doubled in size, it has been more than
doubled in literary value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miscellanea of the omnium-gatherum sort appear to be as acceptable
to-day as they undoubtedly were in the youthful period of our
literature, though for an opposite reason. When books were scarce,
and costly, and inaccessible, anxious readers found in “scripscrapologia”
multifarious sources of instruction; now that books are like
the stars for multitude, the reader who is appalled by their endless
succession and variety is fain to receive with thankfulness the cream
that is skimmed and the grain that is sifted by patient hands for
his use. Our ancestors were regaled with such olla-podrida as “The
Gallimaufry: a Kickshaw [Fr. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quelque chose</span></i>] Treat which comprehends
odd bits and scraps, and odds and ends;” or “The Wit’s Miscellany:
odd and uncommon epigrams, facetious drolleries, whimsical mottoes,
merry tales, and fables, for the entertainment and diversion of good
company.” To the present generation is accorded a wider field for
excursion, from the Curiosities of Disraeli, and the Commonplaces of
Southey, to the less ambitious collections of less learned collaborators.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Into a hotch-potch,” says Sir Edward Coke, “is commonly put not
one thing alone, but one thing with other things together.” The
present volume is an expedient for grouping together a variety which
will be found in no other compilation. From the nonsense of literary
trifling to the highest expression of intellectual force; from the
anachronisms of art to the grandest revelations of science; from
selections for the child to extracts for the philosopher, it will accommodate
the widest diversity of taste, and furnish entertainment for all
ages, sexes, and conditions. As a pastime for the leisure half-hour, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>home or abroad; as a companion by the fireside, or the seaside, amid
the hum of the city, or in the solitude of rural life; as a means of relaxation
for the mind jaded by business activities, it may be safely
commended to acceptance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aim of this collation is not to be exhaustive, but simply to be
well compacted. The restrictive limits of an octavo require the
winnowings of selection in place of the bulk of expansion. Gargantua,
we are told by Rabelais, wrote to his son Pantagruel,
commanding him to learn Greek, Latin, Chaldaic, and Arabic; all
history, geometry, arithmetic, music, astronomy, natural philosophy,
etc., “so that there be not a river in the world thou dost not know
the name and nature of all its fishes; all the fowls of the air; all the
several kinds of shrubs and herbs; all the metals hid in the bowels of
the earth, all gems and precious stones. I would furthermore have
thee study the Talmudists and Cabalists, and get a perfect knowledge
of man. In brief, I would have thee a bottomless pit of all knowledge.”
While this book does not aspire to such Gargantuan comprehensiveness,
it seeks a higher grade of merit than that which attaches
to those who “chronicle small beer,” or to him who is merely “a
snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Quaint old Burton, in describing the travels of Paulus Emilius,
says, “He took great content, exceeding delight in that his voyage, as
who doth not that shall attempt the like? For peregrination charms
our senses with such unspeakable and sweet variety, that some count
him unhappy that never traveled, a kind of prisoner, and pity his
case that from his cradle to his old age beholds the same still; still,
still, the same, the same.” It is the purpose of these <span class='sc'>Gleanings</span> to
compass such “sweet variety” by conducting the reader here, through
the green lanes of freshened thought, and there, through by-paths
neglected and gray with the moss of ages; now, amid cultivated
fields, and then, adown untrodden ways; at one time, to rescue from
oblivion fugitive thoughts which the world should not “willingly let
die,” at another, to restore to sunlight gems which have been too long
“underkept and down supprest.” The compiler asks the tourist to
accompany him, because with him, as with Montaigne and Hans
Andersen, there is no pleasure without communication, and though
all men may find in these Collectanea some things which they will
recognize as old acquaintances, yet will they find many more with
which they are unfamiliar, and to which their attention has never
been awakened.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/i_025.jpg' width='100' alt='' />
</div><p class='drop-capi0'>
In No. 59 of the Spectator, Addison,
descanting on the different species of
wit, observes, “The first I shall produce
are the Lipogrammatists, or letter
droppers of antiquity, that would take an
exception, without any reason, against some
particular letter in the alphabet, so as not to
admit it once in a whole poem. One Tryphiodorus
was a great master in this kind of
writing. He composed an Odyssey, or Epic
Poem, on the adventures of Ulysses, consisting
of four-and-twenty-books, having entirely
banished the letter A from his first
book, which was called <cite><span lang="el-Latn" xml:lang="el-Latn">Alpha</span></cite>, (as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucus a
non lucendo</span></i>,) because there was not an alpha
in it. His second book was inscribed <cite><span lang="el-Latn" xml:lang="el-Latn">Beta</span></cite>, for the same reason.
In short, the poet excluded the whole four-and-twenty letters
in their turns, and showed them that he could do his business
without them. It must have been very pleasant to have seen
this Poet avoiding the reprobate letter as much as another
would a false quantity, and making his escape from it, through
the different Greek dialects, when he was presented with it in
any particular syllable; for the most apt and elegant word in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the whole language was rejected, like a diamond with a flaw in
it, if it appeared blemished with the wrong letter.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In No. 63, Addison has again introduced Tryphiodorus, in
his Vision of the Region of False Wit, where he sees the phantom
of this poet pursued through the intricacies of a dance by
four-and-twenty persons, (representatives of the alphabet,) who
are unable to overtake him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Addison should, however, have mentioned that Tryphiodorus
is kept in countenance by no less an authority than Pindar,
who, according to Athenæus, wrote an ode from which the
letter <i><span lang="el-Lang" xml:lang="el-Lang">sigma</span></i> was carefully excluded.</p>

<p class='c000'>This caprice of Tryphiodorus has not been without its imitators.
Peter de Riga, a canon of Rheims, wrote a summary
of the Bible in twenty-three sections, and throughout each section
omitted, successively, some particular letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gordianus Fulgentius, who wrote “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Ætatibus Mundi et
Hominis</span>,” has styled his book a wonderful work, chiefly, it
may be presumed, from a similar reason; as from the chapter
on Adam he has excluded the letter A; from that on Abel,
the B; from that on Cain, the C; and so on through twenty-three
chapters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gregorio Letti presented a discourse to the Academy of Humorists
at Rome, throughout which he had purposely omitted
the letter R, and he entitled it <i>the exiled R</i>. A friend having
requested a copy as a literary curiosity, (for so he considered
this idle performance,) Letti, to show it was not so difficult a
matter, replied by a copious answer of seven pages, in which
he observed the same severe ostracism against the letter R.</p>

<p class='c000'>Du Chat, in the “Ducatiana,” says “there are five novels in
prose, of Lope de Vega, similarly avoiding the vowels; the
first without A, the second without E, the third without I, the
fourth without O, and the fifth without U.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Orientalists are not without this literary folly. A Persian
poet read to the celebrated Jami a ghazel of his own composition,
which Jami did not like; but the writer replied it was,
notwithstanding, a very curious sonnet, for the letter <i><span lang="ar-Latn" xml:lang="ar-Latn">Aliff</span></i> was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>not to be found in any of the words! Jami sarcastically answered,
“You can do a better thing yet; take away <i>all the
letters</i> from every word you have written.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This alphabetical whim has assumed other shapes, sometimes
taking the form of a fondness for a particular letter. In the
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecloga de Calvis</span></cite> of Hugbald the Monk, all the words begin
with a C. In the Nugæ Venales there is a Poem by Petrus
Placentius, entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pugna Porcorum</span>, in which every word begins
with a P. In another performance in the same work, entitled
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Canum cum cattis certamen</span></cite>, in which “apt alliteration’s
artful aid” is similarly summoned, every word begins with a C.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord North, one of the finest gentlemen in the Court of
James I., has written a set of sonnets, each of which begins
with a successive letter of the alphabet. The Earl of Rivers,
in the reign of Edward IV., translated the Moral Proverbs of
Christiana of Pisa, a poem of about two hundred lines, almost
all the words of which he contrived to conclude with the letter E.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pangrammatists contrive to crowd all the letters of the
alphabet into every single verse. The prophet Ezra may be
regarded as the father of them, as may be seen by reference to
ch. vii., v. 21, of his Book of Prophecies. Ausonius, a Roman
poet of the fourth century, whose verses are characterized
by great mechanical ingenuity, is fullest of these fancies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following sentence of only 48 letters, contains every
letter of the alphabet:—<i>John P. Brady, give me a black walnut
box of quite a small size</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stanza subjoined is a specimen of both lipogrammatic
and pangrammatic ingenuity, containing every letter of the
alphabet except <i>e</i>. Those who remember that <i>e</i> is the most
indispensable letter, being much more frequently used than
any other,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> will perceive the difficulty of such composition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Lord Holland</span>, after reading the five Spanish novels
already alluded to, in 1824, composed the following curious
example, in which all the vowels except E are omitted:—</p>

<h4 class='c016'>EVE’S LEGEND.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Men were never perfect; yet the three brethren Veres were ever esteemed,
respected, revered, even when the rest, whether the select few, whether the
mere herd, were left neglected.</p>

<p class='c018'>The eldest’s vessels seek the deep, stem the element, get pence; the keen
Peter, when free, wedded Hester Green,—the slender, stern, severe, erect
Hester Green. The next, clever Ned, less dependent, wedded sweet Ellen
Heber. Stephen, ere he met the gentle Eve, never felt tenderness: he kept
kennels, bred steeds, rested where the deer fed, went where green trees,
where fresh breezes, greeted sleep. There he met the meek, the gentle Eve:
she tended her sheep, she ever neglected self: she never heeded pelf, yet
she heeded the shepherds even less. Nevertheless, her cheek reddened
when she met Stephen; yet decent reserve, meek respect, tempered her
speech, even when she shewed tenderness. Stephen felt the sweet effect:
he felt he erred when he fled the sex, yet felt he defenceless when Eve
seemed tender. She, he reflects, never deserved neglect; she never vented
spleen; he esteems her gentleness, her endless deserts; he reverences her
steps; he greets her:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Tell me whence these meek, these gentle sheep,—whence the yet
meeker, the gentler shepherdess?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well bred, we were eke better fed, ere we went where reckless men
seek fleeces. There we were fleeced. Need then rendered me shepherdess,
need renders me sempstress. See me tend the sheep; see me sew the
wretched shreds. Eve’s need preserves the steers, preserves the sheep;
Eve’s needle mends her dresses, hems her sheets; Eve feeds the geese;
Eve preserves the cheese.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Her speech melted Stephen, yet he nevertheless esteems, reveres her. He
bent the knee where her feet pressed the green; he blessed, he begged, he
pressed her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sweet, sweet Eve, let me wed thee; be led where Hester Green, where
Ellen Heber, where the brethren Vere dwell. Free cheer greets thee there;
Ellen’s glees sweeten the refreshment; there severer Hester’s decent reserve
checks heedless jests. Be led there, sweet Eve!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Never! we well remember the Seer. We went where he dwells—we
entered the cell—we begged the decree,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Where, whenever, when, ’twere well</div>
      <div class='line'>Eve be wedded? Eld Seer, tell.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“He rendered the decree; see here the sentence decreed!” Then she
presented Stephen the Seer’s decree. The verses were these:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Ere the green reed be red,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Sweet Eve, be never wed;</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Ere be green the red cheek,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Never wed thee, Eve meek.</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The terms perplexed Stephen, yet he jeered the terms; he resented the
senseless credence, “Seers never err.” Then he repented, knelt, wheedled,
wept. Eve sees Stephen kneel; she relents, yet frets when she remembers
the Seer’s decree. Her dress redeems her. These were the events:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Her well-kempt tresses fell; sedges, reeds, bedecked them. The reeds
fell, the edges met her cheeks; her cheeks bled. She presses the green
sedge where her check bleeds. Red then bedewed the green reed, the
green reed then speckled her red cheek. The red cheek seems green, the
green reed seems red. These were e’en the terms the Eld Seer decreed
Stephen Vere.</p>

<p class='c013'>The celebrated enigma on the letter H, commonly attributed
to Lord Byron,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> is well known. The following amusing petition

<p class='c000'>Rowland Hill, when at college, was remarkable for the frequent
wittiness of his observations. In a conversation on the
powers of the letter H, in which it was contended that it was no
letter, but a simple aspiration or breathing, Rowland took the
opposite side of the question, and insisted on its being, to all
intents and purposes, a <i>letter</i>; and concluded by observing that,
if it were not, it was a very serious affair to him, as it would
occasion his being <span class='fss'>ILL</span> all the days of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Kohl, the traveller, visited the Church of St. Alexander
Nevskoi, at St. Petersburg, his guide, pointing to a corner

<h4 class='c016'>COMPLIMENTARY CONSIDERATIONS CONCERNING CHESS.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Cherished chess! The charms of thy checkered chambers chain me
changelessly. Chaplains have chanted thy charming choiceness; chieftains
have changed the chariot and the chase for the chaster chivalry of the
chess-board, and the cheerier charge of the chess-knights. Chaste-eyed
Caissa! For thee are the chaplets of chainless charity and the chalice of
childlike cheerfulness. No chilling churl, no cheating chafferer, no chattering
changeling, no chanting charlatan can be thy champion; the chivalrous,
the charitable, and the cheerful are the chosen ones thou cherishest.
Chance cannot change thee: from the cradle of childhood to the charnel-house,
from our first childish chirpings to the chills of the churchyard,
thou art our cheery, changeless chieftainess. Chastener of the churlish,
chider of the changeable, cherisher of the chagrined, the chapter of thy
chiliad of charms should be chanted in cherubic chimes by choicest choristers,
and chiselled on chalcedon in cherubic chirography.</p>

<p class='c017'>“A famous fish-factor found himself father of five flirting females—Fanny,
Florence, Fernanda, Francesca, and Fenella. The first four were
flat-featured, ill-favored, forbidding-faced, freckled frumps, fretful, flippant,
foolish, and flaunting. Fenella was a fine-featured, fresh, fleet-footed fairy,
frank, free, and full of fun. The fisher failed, and was forced by fickle
fortune to forego his footman, forfeit his forefathers’ fine fields, and find a
forlorn farm-house in a forsaken forest. The four fretful females, fond of
figuring at feasts in feathers and fashionable finery, fumed at their fugitive
father. Forsaken by fulsome, flattering fortune-hunters, who followed them
when first they flourished, Fenella fondled her father, flavored their food,
forgot her flattering followers, and frolicked in a frieze without flounces.
The father, finding himself forced to forage in foreign parts for a fortune,
found he could afford a faring to his five fondlings. The first four were fain
to foster their frivolity with fine frills and fans, fit to finish their father’s
finances; Fenella, fearful of flooring him, formed a fancy for a full fresh
flower. Fate favored the fish-factor for a few days, when he fell in with a
fog; his faithful Filley’s footsteps faltered, and food failed. He found himself
in front of a fortified fortress. Finding it forsaken, and feeling himself
feeble, and forlorn with fasting, he fed on the fish, flesh, and fowl he found,
fricasseed, and when full fell flat on the floor. Fresh in the forenoon, he
forthwith flew to the fruitful fields, and not forgetting Fenella, he filched a
fair flower; when a foul, frightful, fiendish figure flashed forth: ‘Felonious
fellow, fingering my flowers, I’ll finish you! Fly; say farewell to your fine
felicitous family, and face me in a fortnight!’ The faint-hearted fisher
fumed and faltered, and fast and far was his flight. His five daughters
flew to fall at his feet and fervently felicitate him. Frantically and fluently
he unfolded his fate. Fenella, forthwith fortified by filial fondness, followed
her father’s footsteps, and flung her faultless form at the foot of the frightful
figure, who forgave the father, and fell flat on his face, for he had
fervently fallen in a fiery fit of love for the fair Fenella. He feasted her
till, fascinated by his faithfulness, she forgot the ferocity of his face, form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and features, and frankly and fondly fixed Friday, fifth of February, for
the affair to come off. There was festivity, fragrance, finery, fireworks,
fricasseed frogs, fritters, fish, flesh, fowl, and frumentry, frontignac, flip,
and fare fit for the fastidious; fruit, fuss, flambeaux, four fat fiddlers and
fifers; and the frightful form of the fortunate and frumpish fiend fell from
him, and he fell at Fenella’s feet a fair-favored, fine, frank, freeman of the
forest. Behold the fruits of filial affection.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>MOTIVES TO GRATITUDE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>A remarkable example of the old fondness for antithesis
and alliteration in composition, is presented in the following
extract from one of Watts’ sermons:—</p>

<p class='c018'>The last great help to thankfulness is to compare various circumstances
and things together. Compare, then, your sorrows with your<a id='t37'></a> sins; compare
your mercies with your merits; compare your comforts with your
calamities; compare your own troubles with the troubles of others; compare
your sufferings with the sufferings of Christ Jesus, your Lord; compare
the pain of your afflictions with the profit of them; compare your
chastisements on earth with condemnation in hell; compare the present
hardships you bear with the happiness you expect hereafter, and try
whether all these will not awaken thankfulness.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ACROSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The acrostic, though an old and favorite form of verse, in
our own language has been almost wholly an exercise of ingenuity,
and has been considered fit only for trivial subjects, to
be classed among <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nugæ literariæ</span></i>. The word in its derivation
includes various artificial arrangements of lines, and many fantastic
conceits have been indulged in. Generally the acrostic
has been formed of the first letters of each line; sometimes of
the last; sometimes of both; sometimes it is to be read downward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>sometimes upward. An ingenious variety called the
Telestich, is that in which the letters beginning the lines spell
a word, while the letters ending the lines, when taken together,
form a word of an opposite meaning, as in this instance:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the fanciful and trifling tricks of poetasters have
been carried to excess, and acrostics have come in for their
share of satire, the origin of such artificial poetry was of a
higher dignity. When written documents, were yet rare, every
artifice was employed to enforce on the attention or fix on the
memory the verses sung by bards or teachers. Alphabetic
associations formed obvious and convenient aids for this purpose.
In the Hebrew Psalms of David, and in other parts of
Scripture, striking specimens occur. The peculiarity is not
retained in the translations, but is indicated in the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>version of the 119th Psalm by the initial letters prefixed to its
divisions. The Greek Anthology also presents examples of
acrostics, and they were often used in the old Latin language.
Cicero, in his treatise “De Divinatione,” has this remarkable
passage:—“The verses of the Sybils (said he) are distinguished
by that arrangement which the Greeks call Acrostic; where,
from the first letters of each verse in order, words are formed
which express some particular meaning; as is the case with
some of Ennius’s verses, the initial letters of which make
‘which Ennius wrote!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the modern examples of acrostic writing, the most
remarkable may be found in the works of Boccaccio. It is a
poem of fifty cantos, of which Guinguenè has preserved a specimen
in his Literary History of Italy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A successful attempt has recently been made to use this form
of verse for conveying useful information and expressing agreeable
reflections, in a volume containing a series of acrostics on
eminent names, commencing with Homer, and descending
chronologically to our own time. The alphabetic necessity of
the choice of words and epithets has not hindered the writer
from giving distinct and generally correct character to the biographical
subjects, as may be seen in the following selections,
which are as remarkable for the truth and discrimination of the
descriptions as for the ingenuity of the diction:</p>

<p class='c000'>Camden, in a chapter in his <cite>Remains</cite>, on this frivolous and
now almost obsolete intellectual exercise, defines Anagrams to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>be a dissolution of a name into its letters, as its elements; and
a new connection into words is formed by their transposition, if
possible, without addition, subtraction, or change of the letters:
and the words should make a sentence applicable to the person
or thing named. The anagram is complimentary or satirical;
it may contain some allusion to an event, or describe some personal
characteristic. Thus, Sir Thomas Wiat bore his own
designation in his name:—</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that the cabalists among the Jews were professed
anagrammatists, the third part of their art called <i>themuru</i>
(changing) being nothing more than finding the hidden and

combining the letters of those names. Thus, of the letters of
<i>Noah’s</i> name in Hebrew, they made <i>grace</i>; and of the <i>Messiah</i>
they made <i>he shall rejoice</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHRONOGRAMS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Addison, in his remarks on the different species of false wit,
(Spect. No. 60,) thus notices the chronogram. “This kind
of wit appears very often on modern medals, especially those
of Germany, when they represent in the inscription the year in
which they were coined. Thus we see on a medal of Gustavus
Adolphus the following words:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ChrIstVs DuX ergo trIVMphVs.</span></span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>If you take the pains to pick the figures out of the several
words, and range them in their proper order, you will find they
amount to MDCXVVVII, or 1627, the year in which the
medal was stamped; for as some of the letters distinguish
themselves from the rest and overtop their fellows, they are to
be considered in a double capacity, both as letters and as
figures. Your laborious German wits will turn over a whole
dictionary for one of these ingenious devices. A man would
think they were searching after an apt classical term; but instead
of that they are looking out a word that has an L, an M,
or a D, in it. When therefore we meet with any of these inscriptions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>we are not so much to look in them for the thought
as for the year of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Apropos of this humorous allusion to the <i>Germanesque</i>
character of the chronogram, it is worthy of notice that European
tourists find far more numerous examples of it in the inscriptions
on the churches on the banks of the Rhine than in
any other part of the continent.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RECURRENT, RECIPROCAL, OR REVERSIBLE WORDS AND VERSES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The only fair specimen we can find of reciprocal words, or
those which, read backwards or forwards, are the same, is the
following couplet, which, according to an old book, cost the
author a world of foolish labor:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Odo tenet mulum, madidam mulum tenet Odo.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The following admired reciprocal lines, addressed to St. Martin
by Satan, according to the legend, the reader will find on
perusal, either backwards or forwards, precisely the same:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signa te signa; temere me tangis et angis;</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>[St. Martin having given up the profession of a soldier, and having been
made Bishop of Tours, when prelates neither kept carriages nor servants,
had occasion to go to Rome, in order to consult the Pope upon ecclesiastical
matters. As he was walking along the road he met the devil, who politely
accosted him, and ventured to observe how fatiguing and indecorous it was
for him to perform so long a journey on foot, like the commonest pilgrim.
The Saint understood the drift of Old Nick’s address, and commanded him
immediately to become a beast of burden, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jumentum</span></i>; which the devil
did in a twinkling by assuming the shape of a mule. The Saint jumped
upon the fiend’s back, who at first trotted cheerfully along, but soon slackened
his pace. The bishop of course had neither whip nor spurs, but was
possessed of a much more powerful stimulus, for, says the legend, he made
the sign of the cross, and the smarting devil instantly galloped away. Soon
however, and naturally enough, the father of sin returned to sloth and obstinacy,
and Martin hurried him again with repeated signs of the cross,
till, twitched and stung to the quick by those crossings so hateful to him,
the vexed and tired reprobate uttered the foregoing distich in a rage,
meaning, <i>Cross, cross yourself; you annoy and vex me without necessity; for
owing to my exertions, Rome, the object of your wishes, will soon be near</i>.]</p>

      <div class='line in2'>monsters, who think by confining to secure—</div>
      <div class='line'>—a wife, it is his maxim to treat as a</div>

      <div class='line'>—plaything, or menial slave, the woman</div>

      <div class='line'>—than a glass; and his intoxication</div>
      <div class='line in2'>(for so I must call the excess of his love)</div>

      <div class='line in2'>of its object, and wish I could be more deserving</div>

      <div class='line'>—crown the whole—my former gallant lover</div>
      <div class='line in2'>is now my indulgent husband; my husband</div>
      <div class='line'>—is returned, and I might have had</div>

<p class='c013'>Count Valavoir, a general in the French service under Turenne,
while encamped before the enemy, attempted one night

see.” The soldier, who took the words in this sense, indignantly
repeated the challenge, and was answered in the same

      <div class='line in4'>“More than he made of it.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c016'>A PATRIOTIC TOAST.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Most readers will remember the story of a non-committal
editor who, during the Presidential canvass of 1872, desiring to
propitiate subscribers of both parties, hoisted the ticket of
“Gr—— and ——n” at the top of his column, thus giving
those who took the paper their choice of interpretations between
“Grant and Wilson” and “Greeley and Brown.” A
story turning on the same style of point—and probably quite
as apocryphal—though the author labels it “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">historique</span></i>”—is
told of an army officers’ mess in France. A brother-soldier
from a neighboring detachment having come in, and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">champenoise</span></i>
having been uncorked in his honor, “Gentlemen,”
said the guest, raising his glass, “I am about to propose a
toast at once patriotic and political.” A chorus of hasty
ejaculations and of murmurs at once greeted him. “Yes,
gentlemen,” coolly proceeded the orator, “I drink to a thing
which—an object that—Bah! I will out with it at once. It
begins with an <i>R</i> and ends with an <i>e</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Capital!” whispers a young lieutenant of Bordeaux promotion.
“He proposes the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">République</span></i>, without offending the
old fogies by saying the word,”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nonsense! He means the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Radicale</span></i>,” replies the other,
an old Captain Cassel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon my word,” says a third, as he lifts his glass, “our
friend must mean <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Royauté</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“I see!” cries a one-legged veteran of Froschweiler: “we
drink to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la Revanche</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In fact the whole party drank the toast heartily, each interpreting
it to his liking.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the hands of a Swift, even so trivial an instance might
be made to point a moral on the facility with which, alike in
theology and politics—from Athanasian creed to Cincinnati
or Philadelphia platform—men comfortably interpret to their
own diverse likings some doctrine that “begins with an <i>R</i>
and ends with an <i>e</i>,” and swallow it with great unanimity and
enthusiasm.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL.</h4>

<p class='c013'>During the war of the Rebellion, a merchant of Milwaukee,
who is an excellent hand at sketching, drew most admirably
on the wall of his store a negro’s head, and underneath it
wrote, in a manner worthy of the Delphic oracle, “Dis-Union
for eber.” Whether the sentence meant loyalty to the Union
or not, was the puzzling question which the gentleman himself
never answered, invariably stating to the inquirers, “Read
it for yourselves, gentlemen.” So from that day to this, as
the saying goes, “no one knows how dat darkey stood on de
war question.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another question is puzzling the young ladies who attend
a Western Female College. It seems that one of them discovered
that some person had written on the outer wall of the
college, “Young women should set good examples; for young
men <i>will</i> follow them.” The question that is now perplexing
the heads of several of the young ladies of the college is,
whether the writer meant what he or she (the handwriting was
rather masculine) wrote, in a moral sense or in an ironical one.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>HOW FRENCH ACTRESSES AVOID GIVING THEIR AGE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>A servant robbed Mlle. Mars of her diamonds one evening
while she was at the theatre. Arrested, he was put upon
trial, and witnesses were summoned to bear testimony to his
guilt. Among these was Mlle. Mars. She was greatly annoyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>at this, as, according to the rules of French practice,
the witness, after being sworn, gives his age. Now the age
of Mlle. Mars was an impenetrable mystery, for it was a
theme she never alluded to, and she possessed the art of
arresting time’s flight, or at least of repairing its ravages so
effectually that her face never revealed acquaintance with
more than twenty years. She was for some days evidently
depressed; then, all at once, her spirits rose as buoyant as
ever. This puzzled the court—for people in her eminent
position always have a court; parasites are plenty in Paris—they
did not know whether she had determined frankly to
confess her age, or whether she had hit upon some means of
eluding this thorny point of practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day of trial came, and she was at her place. The
court-room was filled, and when she was put in the witness-box
every ear was bent towards her to catch the age she would
give as her own. “Your name?” said the presiding judge.
“Anne Francoise Hippolyte Mars.” “What is your profession?”
“An actress of the French Comedy.” “What is
your age?” “——ty years.” “What?” inquired the presiding
judge, leaning forward. “I have just told your honor!”
replied the actress, giving one of those irresistible smiles which
won the most hostile pit. The judge smiled in turn, and
when he asked, as he did immediately, “Where do you live?”
hearty applause long prevented Mlle. Mars from replying.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mlle. Cico was summoned before a court to bear witness in
favor of some cosmetic assailed as a poison by victims and
their physicians. All the youngest actresses of Paris were
there, and they reckoned upon a good deal of merriment and
profit when Mlle. Cico came to disclose her age. She was
called to the stand—sworn—gave her name and profession.
When the judge said “How old are you?” she quitted the
stand, went up to the bench, stood on tip-toe, and whispered
in the judge’s ear the malicious mystery. The bench smiled,
and kept her secret.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h2 id='c73' class='c006'>The Cento.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A cento primarily signifies a cloak made of patches. In
poetry it denotes a work wholly composed of verses, or passages
promiscuously taken from other authors and disposed in a new
form or order, so as to compose a new work and a new meaning.
According to the rules laid down by Ausonius, the author
of the celebrated <cite>Nuptial Cento</cite>, the pieces may be taken from
the same poet, or from several; and the verses may be either
taken entire, or divided into two, one half to be connected with
another half taken elsewhere; but two verses are never to be
taken together.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Empress Eudoxia wrote the life of Jesus Christ in centos
taken from Homer. Proba Falconia, and, long after him,
Alexander Ross, both composed a life of the Saviour, in the
same manner, from Virgil. The title of Ross’ work, which
was republished in 1769, was <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virgilius Evangelizans, sive historia
Domini et Salvatoris nostri Jesu Christi Virgilianis
verbis et versibus descripta</span></cite>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouts Rimés</span>, or Rhyming Ends, afford considerable amusement.
They are said by Goujet to have been invented by
Dulot, a French poet, who had a custom of preparing the
rhymes of sonnets, leaving them to be filled up at leisure.
Having been robbed of his papers, he was regretting the loss
of three hundred sonnets. His friends were astonished that
he had written so many of which they had never heard. “They
were blank sonnets,” said he, and then explained the mystery
by describing his “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bouts Rimés</span>.” The idea appeared ridiculously
amusing, and it soon became a fashionable pastime to
collect some of the most difficult rhymes, and fill up the lines.
An example is appended:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>nettle,</div>
      <div class='line'>pains.</div>
      <div class='line'>mettle.</div>
      <div class='line'>remains.</div>
      <div class='line'>natures.</div>
      <div class='line'>rebel.</div>
      <div class='line'>graters.</div>
      <div class='line'>well.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The rhymes may be thus completed:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tender-handed stroke a nettle,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And it stings you for your pains;</div>
      <div class='line'>Grasp it like a man of mettle,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And it soft as silk remains.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis the same with common natures,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Use them kindly, they rebel;</div>
      <div class='line'>But be rough as nutmeg-graters,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the rogues obey you well.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A sprightly young belle, who was an admirer of poetry, would
often tease her beau, who had made some acquaintance with the
muses, to write verses for her. One day, becoming quite importunate,
she would take no denial. “Come, pray, do now
write some poetry for me—won’t you? I’ll help you out. I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>furnish you with rhymes if you will make lines for them.
Here now:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

    <td class='c019'>please,</td>
    <td class='c020'>moan,</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='c019'>tease,</td>
    <td class='c020'>bone.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>He at length good-humoredly complied, and filled up the
measure as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To a form that is faultless, a face that must—please,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is added a restless desire to—tease;</div>
      <div class='line'>O, how my hard fate I should ever be—moan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could I but believe she’d be bone of my—bone!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Bogart, a young man of Albany, who died in 1826, at
the age of twenty-one, displayed astonishing facility in impromptu
writing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was good-naturedly hinted on one occasion that his “impromptus”
were prepared beforehand, and he was asked if he
would submit to the application of a test of his poetic abilities.
He promptly acceded, and a most difficult one was immediately
proposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among his intimate friends were Col. J. B. Van Schaick
and Charles Fenno Hoffman, both of whom were present. Said
Van Schaick, taking up a copy of Byron, “The name of Lydia
Kane” (a lady distinguished for her beauty and cleverness,
who died a few years ago, but who was then just blushing into
womanhood) “has in it the same number of letters as a stanza
of Childe Harold has lines: write them down in a column.”
They were so written by Bogart, Hoffman, and himself.
“Now,” he continued, “I will open the poem at random; and
for the ends of the lines in Miss Lydia’s <cite>Acrostic</cite> shall be used
the words ending those of the verse on which my finger may
rest.” The stanza thus selected was this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And must they fall, the young, the proud, the brave,</div>
      <div class='line'>To swell one bloated chief’s unwholesome reign?</div>
      <div class='line'>No step between submission and a grave?</div>
      <div class='line'>The rise of rapine and the fall of Spain?</div>
      <div class='line'>And doth the Power that man adores ordain</div>
      <div class='line'>Their doom, nor heed the suppliant’s appeal?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is all that desperate valor acts in vain?</div>
      <div class='line'>And counsel sage, and patriotic zeal,</div>
      <div class='line'>The veteran’s skill, youth’s fire, and manhood’s heart of steel?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The following stanza was composed by Bogart within the
succeeding ten minutes,—the period fixed in a wager,—finished
before his companions had reached a fourth line, and read to
them as here presented:<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c000'>The French also amuse themselves with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouts rimés retournés</span></i>,
in which the rhymes are taken from some piece of poetry, but
the order in which they occur is reversed. The following example
is from the album of a Parisian lady of literary celebrity,
the widow of one of the Crimean heroes. The original poem is
by Alfred de Musset, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retournés</span></i> by Marshal Pelissier, who
improvised it at the lady’s request. In the translation which

<p class='c007'>The quaint conceit of making verses assume grotesque
shapes and devices, expressive of the theme selected by the
writer, appears to have been most fashionable during the seventeenth
century. Writers tortured their brains in order to torture
their verses into all sorts of fantastic forms, from a flowerpot
to an obelisk, from a pin to a pyramid. Hearts and fans
and knots were chosen for love-songs; wineglasses, bottles,
and casks for Bacchanalian songs; pulpits, altars, and monuments
for religious verses and epitaphs. Tom Nash, according
to Disraeli, says of Gabriel Harvey, that “he had writ verses
in all kinds: in form of a pair of gloves, a pair of spectacles,
a pair of pot-hooks, &amp;c.” Puttenham, in his <cite>Art of Poesie</cite>,
gives several odd specimens of poems in the form of lozenges,
pillars, triangles, &amp;c. Butler says of Benlowes, “the excellently
learned,” who was much renowned for his literary
freaks, “As for temples and pyramids in poetry, he has outdone
all men that way; for he has made a <i>grid-iron</i> and a
<i>frying-pan</i> in verse, that, besides the likeness in shape, the
very tone and sound of the words did perfectly represent the
noise made by these utensils! When he was a captain, he
made all the furniture of his horse, from the bit to the crupper,
the beaten poetry, every verse being fitted to the proportion of
the thing, with a moral allusion to the sense of the thing: as
the <i>bridle of moderation</i>, the <i>saddle of content</i>, and the <i>crupper
of constancy</i>; so that the same thing was the epigram
and emblem, even as a mule is both horse and ass.” Mr. Alger
tells us that the Oriental poets are fond of arranging their poems
in the form of drums, swords, circles, crescents, trees, &amp;c., and
that the Alexandrian rhetoricians used to amuse themselves by

<h4 class='c016'>EXPLANATION.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The middle cross represents our Saviour; those on either side, the two
thieves. On the top and down the middle cross are our Saviour’s expression,
“My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken me?” and on the top of the
cross is the Latin inscription, “INRI”—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judæorum</span>,
<i>i.e.</i> Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. Upon the cross on the right-hand
is the prayer of one of the thieves:—“Lord! remember me when thou comest
into thy kingdom.” On the left-hand cross is the saying, or reproach, of the
other:—“If thou beest the Christ, save thyself and us.” The whole, comprised
together, makes a piece of excellent poetry, which is to be read across all the
columns, and makes as many lines as there are letters in the alphabet. It is
perhaps one of the most curious pieces of composition to be found on record.</p>

by reference to abundant examples, that many of the finest passages
in our language are nearly, if not altogether, monosyllabic.
Indeed, it could not well be otherwise, if it be true that, as
Dean Swift has remarked, the English language is “overstocked
with monosyllables.” It contains more than five
hundred formed by the vowel <i>a</i> alone; four hundred and fifty
by the vowel <i>e</i>; nearly four hundred by the vowel <i>i</i>; more
than four hundred by the vowel <i>o</i>; and two hundred and sixty
by the vowel <i>u</i>; besides a large number formed by diphthongs.
Floy has written a lengthy and very ingenious article, entirely
in monosyllables, in which he undertakes, as he says, to “prove
that short words, in spite of the sneer in the text, need not
creep, nor be dull, but that they give strength, and life, and
fire to the verse of those who know how to use them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pope himself, however, has confuted his own words by his
admirable writings more effectively than could be done by
labored argument. Many of the best lines in the Essay above
referred to, as well as in the Essay on Man,—and there are few
“dull” or “creeping” verses to be found in either,—are made
up entirely of monosyllables, or contain but one word of greater
length, or a contracted word pronounced as one syllable. The
Universal Prayer—one of the most beautiful and elaborate
pieces, both in sentiment and versification, ever produced in
any language—contains three hundred and four words, of which
there are two hundred and forty-nine monosyllables to fifty-five
polysyllables, thus averaging but one of the latter to every line.
A single stanza is appended as a specimen:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Rogers, conversing on this subject, cited two lines from

<h3 class='c012'>ACCURACY OF THE BIBLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of the most remarkable results of modern research is
the confirmation of the accuracy of the historical books of the
Old Testament. The ruins of Babylon and Nineveh shed a
light on those books which no skepticism can invalidate. What
surprises us most is their marvellous accuracy in minute details,
which are now substantiated by recent discoveries. The fact
seems to be that when writing was laboriously performed on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>stone, men had an almost superstitious conscientiousness in
making their records true, and had not learned the modern indifference
to truth which our facile modes of communicating
thought have encouraged. A statement to be chiselled on rock
must be correct; a statement which can be written in five
minutes is likely to embody only first impressions, which may
be amended in five minutes thereafter. Hence it comes to pass
that we know more exactly many things which took place in
the wars between Sennacherib and Hezekiah, than we know
what is the precise truth with regard to some of the occurrences
in the battle of Bunker’s Hill. Sir Henry Rawlinson,
speaking of his researches in Babylon, states that the name
and situation of every town of note in ancient Assyria, mentioned
in the Bible, can be substantiated by the ruins of that
city. The visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon is perfectly
verified. The prosecution of the researches will be regarded
with great interest as corroborating the truth of Scripture.</p>

<p class='c000'>An astonishing feature of the word of God is, notwithstanding
the time at which its compositions were written, and the
multitude of the topics to which it alludes, there is not one
physical error,—not one assertion or allusion disproved by the
progress of modern science. None of those mistakes which
the science of each succeeding age discovered in the books preceding;
above all, none of those absurdities which modern
astronomy indicates in such great numbers in the writings of
the ancients,—in their sacred codes, in their philosophy, and
even in the finest pages of the fathers of the Church,—not one of
these errors is to be found in any of our sacred books. Nothing
there will ever contradict that which, after so many ages, the
investigations of the learned world have been able to reveal to
us on the state of our globe, or on that of the heavens. Peruse
with care the Scriptures from one end to the other, to find such
blemishes, and, whilst you apply yourselves to this examination,
remember that it is a book which speaks of every thing,
which describes nature, which recites its creation, which tells
us of the water, of the atmosphere, of the mountains, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>animals, and of the plants. It is a book which teaches us the
first revolutions of the world, and which also foretells its last.
It recounts them in the circumstantial language of history, it
extols them in the sublimest strains of poetry, and it chants
them in the charms of glowing song. It is a book which is full
of Oriental rapture, elevation, variety, and boldness. It is a
book which speaks of the heavenly and invisible world, whilst
it also speaks of the earth and things visible. It is a book
which nearly fifty writers, of every degree of cultivation, of
every state, of every condition, and living through the course
of fifteen hundred years, have concurred to make. It is a book
which was written in the centre of Asia, in the sands of Arabia,
in the deserts of Judea, in the court of the Temple of the Jews,
in the music-schools of the prophets of Bethel and Jericho, in
the sumptuous palaces of Babylon, and on the idolatrous banks
of Chebar; and finally, in the centre of Western civilization, in
the midst of the Jews and of their ignorance, in the midst of
polytheism and its sad philosophy. It is a book whose first
writer had been forty years a pupil of the magicians of Egypt,
in whose opinion the sun, the stars, and elements were endowed
with intelligence, reacted on the elements, and governed
the world by a perpetual illuvium. It is a book whose first
writer preceded, by more than nine hundred years, the most
ancient philosophers of ancient Greece and Asia,—the Thaleses,
and the Pythagorases, the Zaleucuses, the Xenophons, and the
Confuciuses. It is a book which carries its narrations even to
the hierarchies of angels—even to the most distant epochs of
the future, and the glorious scenes of the last day. Well:
search among its fifty authors, search among its sixty-six
books, its eleven hundred and eighty-nine chapters, and its
thirty-one thousand one hundred and seventy-three verses;
search for only one of those thousand errors which the ancients
and moderns have committed in speaking of the heavens
or of the earth—of their revolutions, of their elements; search—but
you will find none.</p>

regularly and attentively read these Holy Scriptures, and am
of opinion that this volume, independently of its Divine origin,
contains more sublimity and beauty, more pure morality,
more important history and finer strains of poetry and eloquence,
than can be collected from all other books, in whatever
age or language they may have been composed.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Rousseau</span> says, “This Divine Book, the only one which is
indispensable to the Christian, need only be read with reflection
to inspire love for its author, and the most ardent desire
to obey its precepts. Never did virtue speak so sweet a language;
never was the most profound wisdom expressed with so
much energy and simplicity. No one can arise from its perusal
without feeling himself better than he was before.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Wilberforce</span>, in his dying hour, said to a friend, “Read
the Bible. Let no religious book take its place. Through all
my perplexities and distresses, I never read any other book,
and I never knew the want of any other. It has been my
hourly study; and all my knowledge of the doctrines, and all
my acquaintance with the experience and realities, of religion,
have been derived from the Bible only. I think religious people
do not read the Bible enough. Books about religion may
be useful enough, but they will not do instead of the simple
truth of the Bible.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Lord Bolingbroke</span> declared that “the Gospel is, in all
cases, one continued lesson of the strictest morality, of justice,
of benevolence, and of universal charity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Similar testimony has been accorded in the strongest terms
by <span class='sc'>Locke</span>, <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, <span class='sc'>Boyle</span>, <span class='sc'>Selden</span>, <span class='sc'>Salmasius</span>, <span class='sc'>Sir Walter
Scott</span>, and numberless others.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Daniel Webster</span>, having been commended for his eloquence
on a memorable occasion, replied, “If any thing I have ever
said or written deserves the feeblest encomiums of my fellow-countrymen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>I have no hesitation in declaring that for their
partiality I am indebted, solely indebted, to the daily and attentive
perusal of the Holy Scriptures, the source of all true
poetry and eloquence, as well as of all good and all comfort.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>John Quincy Adams</span>, in a letter to his son in 1811, says,
“I have for many years made it a practice to read through the
Bible once every year. My custom is to read four or five chapters
every morning, immediately after rising from my bed. It
employs about an hour of my time, and seems to me the most
suitable manner of beginning the day. In whatsoever light
we regard the Bible, whether with reference to revelation, to
history, or to morality, it is an invaluable and inexhaustible
mine of knowledge and virtue.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Addison</span> says, in relation to the poetry of the Bible,
“After perusing the Book of Psalms, let a judge of the beauties
of poetry read a literal translation of Horace or Pindar,
and he will find in these two last such an absurdity and confusion
of style, with such a comparative poverty of imagination,
as will make him sensible of the vast superiority of Scripture
style.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Lord Byron</span>, in a letter to Mrs. Sheppard, said, in reference
to the truth of Christianity, “Indisputably, the firm
believers in the Gospel have a great advantage over all others,
for this simple reason:—that, if true, they will have their reward
hereafter; and if there be no hereafter, they can be but
with the infidel in his eternal sleep, having had the assistance
of an exalted hope through life, without subsequent disappointment,
since (at the worst, for them) out of nothing nothing
can arise,—not even sorrow.” The following lines of Walter
Scott are said to have been copied in his Bible:—</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>ENGLISH BIBLE TRANSLATIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Our version of the Bible is to be loved and prized for this, as for a thousand
other things,—that it has preserved a purity of meaning to many terms
of natural objects. Without this holdfast, our vitiated imaginations would
refine away language to mere abstractions. Hence the French have lost their
poetical language; and Blanco White says the same thing has happened to
the Spanish.—<span class='sc'>Coleridge.</span></p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Wickliffe’s Bible.</cite>—This was the first translation made into
the language. It was translated by John Wickliffe, about the
year 1384, but never printed, though there are manuscript
copies of it in several public libraries.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Tyndale’s Bible.</cite>—The translation of William Tyndale, assisted
by Miles Coverdale, was the first printed Bible in the
English language. The New Testament was published in
1526. It was revised and republished in 1530. In 1532, Tyndale
and his associates finished the whole Bible, except the
Apocrypha, and printed it abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Matthews’ Bible.</cite>—While Tyndale was preparing a second
edition of the Bible, he was taken up and burned for heresy in
Flanders. On his death, Coverdale and John Rogers revised
it, and added a translation of the Apocrypha. It was dedicated
to Henry VIII., in 1537, and was printed at Hamburg, under
the borrowed name of Thomas Matthews, whence it was called
Matthews’ Bible.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Cranmer’s Bible.</cite>—This was the first Bible printed by authority
in England, and publicly set up in the churches. It was
Tyndale’s version, revised by Coverdale, and examined by Cranmer,
who added a preface to it, whence it was called Cranmer’s
Bible. It was printed by Grafton, in large folio, in 1539.
After being adopted, suppressed, and restored under successive
reigns, a new edition was brought out in 1562.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Geneva Bible.</cite>—In 1557, the whole Bible in quarto was
printed at Geneva by Rowland Harte, some of the English
refugees continuing in that city solely for that purpose. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>translators were Bishop Coverdale, Anthony Gilby, William
Whittingham, Christopher Woodman, Thomas Sampson, and
Thomas Cole—to whom some add John Knox, John Bodleigh,
and John Pullain, all zealous Calvinists, both in doctrine and
discipline. But the chief and most learned of them were the
first three. Of this translation there were about thirty editions,
mostly printed by the King’s and Queen’s printers, from 1560
to 1616. In this version, the first distinction in verses was
made. The following is a copy of the title-page of the
edition of 1559, omitting two quotations from the Scriptures:—</p>

<p class='c000'>To some editions of the Geneva Bible, one of which is this
of 1599, is subjoined Beza’s translation of the new text into
English by L. Tomson, who was under-secretary to Sir Francis
Walsingham. But, though he pretends to translate from Beza,
he has seldom varied a word from the Geneva translation. Dr.
Geddes gives honorable testimony to the last Geneva version, as
he does not hesitate to declare that he thinks it in general
better than that of the King James translators. Our readers
will hardly agree with him when they read some extracts from
it appended in a succeeding paragraph.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The typographical appearance of this work is quite a curiosity.
Like most of the old books, it is well printed, and is
ornamented with the pen. The head and foot rules, as well as
the division of the columns, are made with the pen in red ink.
The title-page is quite profusely ornamented with red lines.</p>

<p class='c000'>This translation of the Bible is known as “the breeches
Bible,” from the following rendering of Genesis iii. 7:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked; and they sewed fig tree leaves together, and made themselves
<i>breeches</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A peculiarity in this Bible is the substitution of the letter <i>v</i>
for <i>u</i>, and, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>, <i>u</i> for <i>v</i>. The name of Eve is printed
Heuah (Hevah); Cain is printed Kain; Abel, Habel; Enoch,
Henock; Isaac, Ishak; Hebrew, Ebrew, &amp;c. The translations
of many of the passages differ materially from our received
version. The following will serve as illustrations:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Thus he cast out man; and at the East side of the garden of Eden he
set the cherubims, and the blade of a sword shaken, to keep the way of the
tree of life.—Genesis iii. 24.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then it repented the Lorde that he had made man in the earth, and he
was sorie in his heart.—Gen. vi. 6.</p>

<p class='c018'>Make thee an Arkee of pine trees; thou shalt make cabins in the Arkee,
and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. Thou shalt make it with
the lower, second and third roome.—Gen. vi. 14, 10.</p>

<p class='c018'>And he said, Hagar, Sarais maide, whence comest thou? &amp; whether wilt
thou go? and she said, I flee from my dame Sarai.—Gen. xvi. 8.</p>

<p class='c018'>When Abram was ninetie years old &amp; nine, the Lord appeared to Abram,
and said unto him, I am God all sufficient, walke before me, and be thou upright.—Gen.
xvii. 1.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then Abraham rose vp from the sight of his corps, and talked with the
Hittites, saying, I am a stranger and a forreiner among you, &amp;c.—Gen.
xxiii. 3, 4.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then Abraham yielded the spirit and died in a good age, an olde man,
and of great yeeres, and was gathered to his people.—Gen. xxv. 8.</p>

<p class='c018'>As many were astonied at thee (his visage was so deformed of men, and
his forme of the sonnes of men) so shall hee spunckle many nations.—Isa. lii.
14. This chapter has but fourteen verses in it.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Can the blacke Moore change his skinne? or the leopard his spots?—Jer.
xiii. 23.</p>

<p class='c018'>And after those days we trussed up our fardles, and went up to Jerusalem.—Acts
xxi. 15.</p>

<p class='c018'>But Jesus sayde vnto her, Let the children first bee fed; for it is not good
to take the childrens bread, and to cast it unto whelps. Then shee answered,
and said unto him, Truthe, Lorde; yet in deede the whelps eate under the
table of the childrens crummes.—Mark vii. 27, 28.</p>

<p class='c018'>And she broght forth her fyrst begotten sonne, and wrapped him in swadlyng
clothes, and layd him in a cretche, bccause there was no rowme for
them with in the ynne.—Luke ii. 7.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Bishops’ Bible.</cite>—Archbishop Parker engaged bishops
and other learned men to bring out a new translation. They
did so in 1568, in large folio. It made what was afterwards
called the great English Bible, and commonly the Bishops’
Bible. In 1589 it was published in octavo, in small, but fine
black letter. In it the chapters were divided into verses, but
without any breaks for them.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Matthew Parker’s Bible.</cite>—The Bishops’ Bible underwent
some corrections, and was printed in large folio in 1572, and
called Matthew Parker’s Bible. The version was used in the
churches for forty years.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Douay Bible.</cite>—The New Testament was brought out
by the Roman Catholics in 1582, and called the Rhemish New
Testament. It was condemned by the Queen of England, and
copies were seized by her authority and destroyed. In 1609
and 1610, the Old Testament was added, and the whole published
at Douay, hence called the Douay Bible.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>King James’s Bible.</cite>—The version now in use was brought out
by King James’s authority in 1611. Fifty-four learned men
were employed to accomplish the work of revising it. From
death or other cause, seven of them failed to enter upon it.
The remaining forty-seven were ranged under six divisions, and
had different portions of the Bible assigned to those divisions.
They commenced their task in 1607. After some three or
four years of diligent labor, the whole was completed. This version
was generally adopted, and the other translations fell into
disuse. It has continued in use until the present time.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>DISTINCTIONS IN THE GOSPELS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>1. In regard to their external features and characteristics:</p>

<p class='c000'>The point of view of the first gospel is mainly Israelitic;
of the second, Gentile; of the third, universal; of the fourth,
Christian.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general aspect, and so to speak, physiognomy of the
first, mainly, is oriental; of the second, Roman; of the third,
Greek; of the fourth, spiritual.</p>

<p class='c000'>The style of the first is stately and rhythmical; of the
second, terse and precise; of the third, calm and copious; of
the fourth, artless and colloquial.</p>

<p class='c000'>The striking characteristic of the first is symmetry; of the
second compression; of the third, order; of the fourth, system.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought and language of the first are both Hebraistic;
of the third, both Hellenistic; while in the second, thought
is often accidental though the language is Hebraistic; and in
the fourth, the language is Hellenistic, but the thought
Hebraistic.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. In respect to their subject-matter and contents:</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first gospel, narrative; in the second, memoirs; in
the third, history; in the fourth, dramatic portraiture.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first we often have the record of events in their accomplishment;
in the second, events in detail; in the third,
events in their connection; in the fourth, events in relation
to the teaching springing from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus in the first we often meet with the notice of impressions;
in the second, of facts; in the third, of motives; in
the fourth, of words spoken.</p>

<p class='c000'>And, lastly, the record of the first is mainly collective, and
often antithetical; of the second, graphic and circumstantial;
of the third, didactic and reflective; of the fourth, selective
and supplemental.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. In respect to their portraiture of our Lord:</p>

<p class='c000'>The first presents him to us mainly as the Messiah; the
second, mainly as the God-man; the third, as the Redeemer;
the fourth, as the only begotten Son of God.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE WORD “SELAH.”</h3>

<p class='c013'>The translators of the Bible have left the Hebrew word
Selah, which occurs so often in the Psalms, as they found it,
and of course the English reader often asks his minister, or
some learned friend, what it means. And the minister or
learned friend has most often been obliged to confess ignorance,
because it is a matter in regard to which the most learned
have by no means been of one mind. The Targums, and most of
the Jewish commentators, give to the word the meaning of <i>eternally
forever</i>. Rabbi Kimchi regards it as a sign to elevate the
voice. The authors of the Septuagint translation appear to have
considered it a musical or rhythmical note. Herder inclines to
the opinion that it indicates a change of tone, which is expressed
either by increase of force, or by a transition into another time
and mode. Matheson thinks it is a musical note, equivalent,
perhaps, to the word <i>repeat</i>. According to Luther and others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>it means <i>silence</i>. Gesenius explains it to mean, “Let the instruments
play and the singers stop.” Wocher regards it as
equivalent to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sursum corda</span></i>,—up, my soul! Sommer, after examining
all the seventy-four passages in which the word occurs,
recognizes in every case “an actual appeal or summons to Jehovah.”
They are calls for aid, and prayers to be heard, expressed
either with entire directness, or if not in the imperative,
Hear, Jehovah! or Awake, Jehovah, and the like, still,
earnest addresses to God that he would remember and hear,
&amp;c. The word itself he considers indicative of a blast of trumpets
by the priests, Selah being an abridged expression for
Higgaion Selah,—Higgaion indicating the sound of the stringed
instruments, and Selah a vigorous blast of trumpets.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PARALLELISM OF THE HEBREW POETRY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The prominent characteristic of the Hebrew poetry is what
Bishop Lowth entitles <i>Parallelism</i>, that is, a certain equality,
resemblance, or relationship, between the members of each
period; so that in two lines, or members of the same period,
things shall answer to things, and words to words, as if fitted
to each other by a kind of rule or measure. The Psalms, Proverbs,
Solomon’s Song, Job, and all the Prophets, except Daniel
and Jonah, abound with instances.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is in a great measure owing to this form of composition
that our admirable authorized version, though executed in
prose, retains so much of a poetical cast; for, being strictly
word for word after the original, the form and order of the original
sentences are preserved; which, by this artificial structure,
this regular alternation and correspondence of parts,
makes the ear sensible of a departure from the common style
and tone of prose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The different kinds of parallels are illustrated in the following
examples:—</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be objected to Hebrew poetry, says Gilfillan, that it
has no regular rhythm except a rude parallelism. What then?
Must it be, therefore, altogether destitute of music? Has not
the rain a rhythm of its own, as it patters on the pane, or sinks
on the bosom of its kindred pool? Has not the wind a harmony,
as it bows the groaning woods, or howls over the mansions
of the dead? Have not the waves of ocean their wild
bass? Has not the thunder its own deep and dreadful organ-pipe?
Do they speak in rhyme? Do they murmur in blank
verse? Who taught them to begin in Iambics, or to close in
Alexandrines? And shall not God’s own speech have a peculiar
note, no more barbarous than is the voice of the old woods
or the older cataracts?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Besides, to call parallelism a coarse or uncouth rhythm, betrays
an ignorance of its nature. Without entering at large
on the subject of Hebrew versification, we may ask any one
who has paid even a slight attention to the subject, if the
effect of parallels such as the foregoing examples, perpetually
intermingled as they are, be not to enliven the composition,
often to give distinctness and precision to the train of thought,
to impress the sentiments upon the memory, and to give out a
harmony which, if inferior to rhyme in the compression produced
by the difficulty (surmounted) of uniting varied sense
with recurring sound, and in the pleasure of surprise; and to
blank verse, in freedom, in the effects produced by the variety
of pause, and in the force of long and linked passages,
as well as of insulated lines, is less slavish than the one, and
less arbitrary than the other? Unlike rhyme, its point is more
that of thought than of language; unlike blank verse, it never
can, however managed, degenerate into heavy prose. Such is
parallelism, which generally forms the differential quality of the
poetry of Scripture, although there are many passages in it
destitute of this aid, and which yet, in the spirit they breathe,
and the metaphors by which they are garnished, are genuine
and high poetry. And there can be little question that in the
parallelism of the Hebrew tongue we can trace many of the
peculiarities of modern writing, and in it find the fountain of
the rhythm, the pomp and antithesis, which lend often such
grace, and always such energy, to the style of Johnson, of Junius,
of Burke, of Hall, of Chalmers,—indeed, of most writers
who rise to the grand swells of prose-poetry.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a remarkable similarity of sound in a passage in the

<h3 class='c012'>PARALLEL PASSAGES BETWEEN SHAKSPEARE AND THE BIBLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>An English minister, Rev. T. R. Eaton, has written a work
entitled <cite>Shakspeare and the Bible</cite>, for the purpose of showing
how much Shakspeare was indebted to the Bible for many of
his illustrations, rhythms, and even modes of feeling. The
author affirms that, in storing his mind, the immortal bard
went first to the word, and then to the works, of God. In
shaping the truths derived from these sources, he obeyed the
instinct implanted by Him who had formed him Shakspeare.
Hence his power of inspiring us with sublime affection for that
which is properly good, and of chilling us with horror by his
fearful delineations of evil. Shakspeare perpetually reminds
us of the Bible, not by direct quotations, indirect allusion, borrowed
idioms, or palpable imitation of phrase or style, but by an
elevation of thought and simplicity of diction which are not to
be found elsewhere. A passage, for instance, rises in our
thoughts, unaccompanied by a clear recollection of its origin.
Our first impression is that it must belong either to the Bible
or Shakspeare. No other author excites the same feeling in an
equal degree. In Shakspeare’s plays religion is a vital and
active principle, sustaining the good, tormenting the wicked,
and influencing the hearts and lives of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the writer carries his leading idea too far, by straining
passages to multiply the instances in which Shakspeare has
imitated scriptural sentences in thought and construction, and
by leading his readers to infer that it was from the Bible Shakspeare
drew not only his best thoughts, but in fact his whole
power of inspiring us with affection for good and horror for
evil, it is certainly true that some hundreds of Biblical allusions,
however brief and simple, show Shakspeare’s conversance
with the Bible, his fondness for it, and the almost unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>recurrence of it in his mind. The following examples of his
parallelisms will be found interesting:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WHO IS THE TRUE GENTLEMAN?</h3>

<p class='c013'>The answer to this question will afford one of numberless
instances that can be adduced to show the superiority of inspired
composition. Compare Bishop Doane’s admired definition
with that of the Psalmist:—</p>

<p class='c018'>A gentleman is but a <i>gentle</i> man—no more, no less; a diamond polished
that was a diamond in the rough: a gentleman is gentle; a gentleman is
modest; a gentleman is courteous; a gentleman is generous; a gentleman
is slow to take offence, as being one that never gives it; a gentleman is slow
to surmise evil, as being one that never thinks it; a gentleman goes armed
only in consciousness of right; a gentleman subjects his appetites; a gentleman
refines his tastes; a gentleman subdues his feelings; a gentleman controls
his speech; and finally, a gentleman deems every other better than
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the paraphrase of Psalm xv. it is thus answered:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

<h3 class='c012'>A SCRIPTURAL BULL.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the book of Isaiah, chapter xxxvii. verse 36, is the following
confusion of ideas:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the
Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and <i>when they
arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WIT AND HUMOR IN THE BIBLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Shocking!” many a good old saint will cry, at the very
thought of it. “The Bible a jest-book! What godless folly
shall we have up next?” No, the Bible is not a jest-book.
But there is wit in it of the first quality; and a good reason
why it should be there. Take a few specimens.</p>

<p class='c000'>Job, in his thirtieth chapter, is telling how he scorned the
low-lived fellows, who pretend to look down on him in his
adversities. They are fools. They belong to the long-eared
fraternity. Anybody, with less wit, might come out bluntly
and call them asses. But Job puts it more deftly (xxx. 7):
“Among the bushes they <i>brayed</i>; under the <i>nettles</i> they were
gathered together.” If that is not wit, there is no such thing
as wit. And yet the commentators don’t see it, or won’t see
it. They are perfectly wooden when they come to any such
gleam of humor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take another instance—Elijah’s ridicule of the prophets
of Baal. They are clamoring to their god, to help them out
of a very awkward predicament. And, while they are at it, the
prophet shows them up in a way that must have made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>people roar with laughter. The stiff, antiquated style of our
English Bible tames down his sallies. Take them in modern
phrase. These quack prophets have worked themselves into
a perfect desperation, and are capering about on the altar as
if they had the St. Vitus’s dance. The scene (I. Kings xviii.
26, 27) wakes up all Elijah’s sense of the ridiculous. “Shout
louder! He is a god, you know. Make him hear! Perhaps
he is chatting with somebody, or he is off on a hunt, or gone
traveling. Or maybe he is taking a nap. Shout away! Wake
him up!” Imagine the priests going through their antics on
the altar, while Elijah bombards them in this style, at his
leisure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paul shows a dry humor more than once, as in II. Cor. xii.
13: “Why haven’t you fared as well as the other churches?
Ah! there is one grievance—that you haven’t had <i>me to support</i>.
Pray do not lay it up against me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>These instances might be multiplied from the Old and New
Testaments both. What do they show? That the Bible is,
on the whole, a humorous book? Far from it. That religion
is a humorous subject—that we are to throw all the wit we
can into the treatment of it? No. But they show that the
sense of the ludicrous is put into a man by his Maker; that
it has its uses, and that we are not to be ashamed of it, or
to roll up our eyes in a holy horror of it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE OLD AND THE NEW TESTAMENT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The name Old Testament was applied to the books of Moses
by St. Paul (II. Cor. iii. 14), inasmuch as the former covenant
comprised the whole scheme of the Mosaic revelation, and the
history of this is contained in them. The phrase “book of
the covenant,” taken from Exod. xxiv. 7, was transferred in
the course of time by metonymy to signify the writings themselves.
The term New Testament has been in common use
since the third century, and was employed by Eusebius in the
sense in which it is now applied.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BIBLIOMANCY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Bibliomancy, or divination by the Bible, had become so common
in the fifth century, that several councils were obliged expressly
to forbid it, as injurious to religion, and savoring of
idolatry.</p>

<p class='c000'>This kind of divination was named <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes Sanctorum</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes
Sacræ</span></i>, Lots of the Saints, or Sacred Lots, and consisted in
suddenly opening, or dipping into, the Bible, and regarding the
passage that first presented itself to the eye as predicting the
future lot of the inquirer. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes Sanctorum</span></i> had succeeded
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes Homericæ</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sortes Virgilianæ</span></i> of the Pagans;
among whom it was customary to take the work of some famous
poet, as Homer or Virgil, and write out different verses on
separate scrolls, and afterwards draw one of them, or else, opening
the book suddenly, consider the first verse that presented
itself as a prognostication of future events. Even the vagrant
fortune-tellers, like some of the gypsies of our own times,
adopted this method of imposing upon the credulity of the
ignorant. The nations of the East retain the practice to the
present day. The famous usurper, Nadir Shah, twice decided
upon besieging cities, by opening at random upon verses of the
celebrated poet Hafiz.</p>

<p class='c000'>This abuse, which was first introduced into the church about
the third century, by the superstition of the people, afterwards
gained ground through the ignorance of some of the clergy, who
permitted prayers to be read in the churches for this very purpose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>It was therefore found necessary to ordain in the Council
of Vannes, held <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 465, “That whoever of the clergy
or laity should be detected in the practice of this art should
be cast out of the communion of the church.” In 506, the
Council of Agde renewed the decree; and in 578, the Council
of Auxerre, amongst other kinds of divination, forbade the
Lots of the Saints, as they were called, adding, “Let all things
be done in the name of the Lord;” but these ordinances did
not effectually suppress them, for we find them again noticed
and condemned in a capitulary or edict of Charlemagne, in 793.
Indeed, all endeavors to banish them from the Christian
church appear to have been in vain for ages.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is singular that the <i>name of God</i> should be spelled with
<i>four letters</i> in almost every known language. It is in Latin,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus</span>; Greek, <span lang="el-Latn" xml:lang="el-Latn">Zeus</span>; Hebrew, <span lang="he-Latn" xml:lang="he-Latn">Adon</span>; Syrian, Adad; Arabian,

<p class='c000'>The name <i>God</i> in the Anglo-Saxon language means <i>good</i>,
and this signification affords singular testimony of the Anglo-Saxon
conception of the essence of the Divine Being. He is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>goodness itself, and the Author of all goodness. Yet the idea
of denoting the Deity by a term equivalent to abstract and absolute
perfection, striking as it may appear, is perhaps less remarkable
than the fact that the word <i>Man</i>, used to designate a
human being, formerly signified <i>wickedness</i>; showing how well
aware were its originators that our fallen nature had become
identified with sin.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>JEHOVAH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The word <i><span lang="he-Latn" xml:lang="he-Latn">Elohim</span></i>, as an appellation of Deity, appears to
have been in use before the Hebrews had attained a national existence.
That <i>Jehovah</i> is specifically the God of the Hebrews
is clear, from the fact that the heathen deities never receive this
name; they are always spoken of as <i><span lang="ha-Latn" xml:lang="ha-Latn">Elohim</span></i>. Both the pronunciation
and the etymological derivation of the word <i><span lang="ha-Latn" xml:lang="ha-Latn">Jehovah</span></i>
are matters of critical controversy. The Jews of later periods
from religious awe abstained from pronouncing it, and whenever
it occurred in reading, substituted the word <i><span lang="he-Latn" xml:lang="he-Latn">Adonai</span></i> (my Lord);
and it is now generally believed that the sublinear vowel signs
attached to the Hebrew tetragrammaton <i><span lang="he-Latn" xml:lang="he-Latn">Jhvh</span></i> belong to the
substituted word. Many believe Jahveh to be the original pronunciation.
The Hebrew root of the word is believed to be
the verb <i><span lang="ha-Latn" xml:lang="ha-Latn">havah</span></i> or <i><span lang="ha-Latn" xml:lang="ha-Latn">hayah</span></i>, to be; hence its meaning throughout
the Scriptures, “the Being,” or “the Everlasting.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GOD IN SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Michelet (<cite>Jeanne d’Arc</cite>,) speaking of English literature, says
that it is “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sceptique, judaique, satanique</span></i>.” In a note he says,
“I do not recollect to have seen the word <span class='sc'>God</span> in Shakspeare.
If it is there at all, it is there very rarely, by chance, and without
a shadow of religious sentiment.” Mrs. Cowden Clarke,
by means of her admirable <cite>Concordance to Shakspeare</cite>, enables
us to weigh the truth of this eminent French writer’s remark.
The word <span class='sc'>God</span> occurs in Shakspeare upwards of <i>one thousand
times</i>, and the word heaven, which is so frequently substituted
for the word <span class='sc'>God</span>—more especially in the historical plays—occurs
about <i>eight hundred times</i>. In the Holy Scriptures, according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to Cruden, it occurs about eight hundred times. It is true that
the word often occurs in Shakspeare without a reverential sentiment;
but M. Michelet says it never occurs with a religious
feeling (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un sentiment religieux</span></i>.) This statement is almost as
erroneous as that regarding the absence of the word. It would
be easy for an English scholar to produce from Shakspeare more
passages indicative of deep religious feeling than are to be found
in any French writer whatever.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE PARSEE, JEW, AND CHRISTIAN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A Jew entered a Parsee temple, and beheld the sacred fire.
“What!” said he to the priest, “do you worship the fire?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not the fire,” answered the priest: “it is to us an emblem
of the sun, and of his genial heat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you then worship the sun as your god?” asked the Jew.
“Know ye not that this luminary also is but a work of that
Almighty Creator?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We know it,” replied the priest: “but the uncultivated
man requires a sensible sign, in order to form a conception of
the Most High. And is not the sun the incomprehensible
source of light, an image of that invisible being who blesses
and preserves all things?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do your people, then,” rejoined the Israelite, “distinguish
the type from the original? They call the sun their god, and,
descending even from this to a baser object, they kneel before
an earthly flame! Ye amuse the outward but blind the inward
eye; and while ye hold to them the earthly, ye draw from them
the heavenly light! ‘Thou shalt not make unto thyself any
image or any likeness.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How do you name the Supreme Being?” asked the Parsee.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We call him Jehovah Adonai, that is, the Lord who is,
who was, and who will be,” answered the Jew.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your appellation is grand and sublime,” said the Parsee;
“but it is awful too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A Christian then drew nigh, and said,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“We call him <span class='sc'>Father</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The Pagan and the Jew looked at each other, and said,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here is at once an image and a reality: it is a word of the
heart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore they all raised their eyes to heaven, and said, with
reverence and love, “<span class='sc'>Our Father!</span>” and they took each
by the hand, and all three called one another <i>brothers</i>!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BEAUTIFUL LEGEND.</h3>

<p class='c013'>One day Rabbi Judah and his brethren, the seven pillars of
Wisdom, sat in the Court of the Temple, on feast-day, disputing
about <span class='fss'>REST</span>. One said that it was to have attained sufficient
wealth, yet without sin. The second, that it was fame and
praise of all men. The third, that it was the possession of
power to rule the State. The fourth, that it consisted only in
a happy home. The fifth, that it must be in the old age of one
who is rich, powerful, famous, surrounded by children and
children’s children. The sixth said that all that were vain,
unless a man keep all the ritual law of Moses. And Rabbi
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Judah, the venerable, the tallest of the brothers, said, “Ye
have spoken wisely; but one thing more is necessary. He only
can find rest, who to all things addeth this, that he keepeth the
tradition of the elders.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There sat in the Court a fair-haired boy, playing with some
lilies in his lap, and, hearing the talk, he dropped them with astonishment
from his hands, and looked up—that boy of twelve—and
said, “Nay, nay, fathers: he only findeth rest, who loveth
his brother as himself, and God with his whole heart and soul.
He is greater than fame, and wealth, and power, happier than
a happy home, happy without it, better than honored age; he
is a law to himself, and above all tradition.” The doctors were
astonished. They said, “When Christ cometh, shall He tell
us greater things?” And they thanked God, for they said,
“The old men are not always wise, yet God be praised, that
out of the mouth of this young suckling has His praise become
perfect.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PERSIAN APOLOGUE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In Sir William Jones’s Persian Grammar may be found the
following beautiful story from <span class='sc'>Nisami</span>. Mr. Alger gives a metrical
translation in his <cite>Poetry of the East</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>One evening Jesus arrived at the gates of a certain city, and
sent his disciples forward to prepare supper, while he himself,
intent on doing good, walked through the streets into the market-place.</p>

<p class='c000'>And he saw at the corner of the market some people gathered
together, looking at an object on the ground; and he drew near
to see what it might be. It was a dead dog, with a halter around
his neck, by which he appeared to have been dragged through
the dirt; and a viler, a more abject, a more unclean thing
never met the eyes of man.</p>

<p class='c000'>And those who stood by looked on with abhorrence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Faugh!” said one, stopping his nose: “it pollutes the air.”
“How long,” said another, “shall this foul beast offend our
sight?” “Look at his torn hide,” said a third: “one could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>not even cut a shoe out of it.” “And his ears,” said a fourth,
“all draggled and bleeding.” “No doubt,” said a fifth, “he
has been hanged for thieving.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Jesus heard them, and looking down compassionately
on the dead creature, he said, “Pearls are not equal to the
whiteness of his teeth!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the people turned towards him with amazement, and
said among themselves, “Who is this? It must be Jesus of
Nazareth, for only <span class='fss'>HE</span> could find something to pity and approve
even in a dead dog.” And being ashamed, they bowed their
heads before him and went each on his way.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following description is alleged to be derived from an
ancient manuscript sent by Publius Lentulus, President of
Judea, to the Senate of Rome:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“There lives at this time in Judea, a man of singular character,
whose name is Jesus Christ. The barbarians esteem him
as their prophet; but his followers adore him as the immediate
offspring of the immortal God. He is endowed with such unparalleled
virtue as to call back the dead from their graves and
to heal every kind of disease with a word or a touch. His
person is tall and elegantly shaped; his aspect, amiable and
reverend; his hair flows in those beauteous shades which no
united colors can match, falling in graceful curls below his
ears, agreeably couching on his shoulders, and parting on the
crown of his head; his dress, that of the sect of Nazarites; his
forehead is smooth and large; his cheeks without blemish,
and of roseate hue; his nose and mouth are formed with exquisite
symmetry; his beard is thick and suitable to the hair of
his head, reaching a little below his chin, and parting in the
middle below; his eyes are clear, bright, and serene.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He rebukes with mildness, and invokes with the most tender
and persuasive language,—his whole address, whether in
word or deed, being elegantly grave, and strictly characteristic
of so exalted a being. No man has seen him laugh, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>whole world beholds him weep frequently, and so persuasive
are his tears that the whole multitude cannot withhold their
tears from joining in sympathy with him. He is moderate,
temperate, and wise: in short, whatever the phenomenon may
turn out in the end, he seems at present to be a man of excellent
beauty and divine perfection, every way surpassing man.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DEATH-WARRANT OF JESUS CHRIST.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of the many interesting relics and fragments brought to light
by the persevering researches of antiquarians, none could be
more interesting to the philanthropist and believer than the following,—to
Christians, the most imposing judicial document
ever recorded in human annals. It has been thus faithfully
transcribed:—</p>

<p class='c034'>Sentence rendered by Pontius Pilate, acting Governor of
Lower Galilee, stating that Jesus of Nazareth shall suffer
death on the cross.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year seventeen of the Emperor Tiberius Cæsar, and
the 27th day of March, the city of the holy Jerusalem—Annas
and Caiaphas being priests, sacrificators of the people of God—Pontius
Pilate, Governor of Lower Galilee, sitting in the presidential
chair of the prætory, condemns Jesus of Nazareth to
die on the cross between two thieves, the great and notorious
evidence of the people saying:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Jesus is a seducer.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. He is seditious.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. He is the enemy of the law.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. He calls himself falsely the Son of God.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. He calls himself falsely the King of Israel.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. He entered into the temple followed by a multitude bearing
palm branches in their hands.</p>

<p class='c034'>Orders the first centurion, Quilius Cornelius, to lead him to
the place of execution.</p>

<p class='c034'>Forbids any person whomsoever, either poor or rich, to oppose
the death of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The witnesses who signed the condemnation of Jesus are—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Daniel Robani, a Pharisee.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Joannus Robani.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>3. Raphael Robani.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Capet, a citizen.</p>

<p class='c034'>Jesus shall go out of the city of Jerusalem by the gate of
Struenus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing is engraved on a copper plate, on the reverse
of which is written, “A similar plate is sent to each tribe.”
It was found in an antique marble vase, while excavating in
the ancient city of Aquilla, in the kingdom of Naples, in the
year 1810, and was discovered by the Commissioners of Arts
of the French army. At the expedition of Naples, it was enclosed
in a box of ebony and preserved in the sacristy of the
Carthusians. The French translation was made by the Commissioners
of Arts. The original is in the Hebrew language.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ANTICIPATORY USE OF THE CROSS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Madame Calderon de la Barca, in her <cite>Life in Mexico</cite> (<i>pub.
1843</i>), says that the symbol of the Cross was known to the
Indians before the arrival of Cortez. In the island of Cozumel,
near Yucatan, there were several; and in Yucatan<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> itself there
was a stone cross. And there an Indian, considered a prophet
among his countrymen, had declared that a nation bearing the
same as a symbol should arrive from a distant country. More
extraordinary still was a temple dedicated to the Holy Cross by
the Toltec nation in the city of Cholula. Near Tulansingo there
is also a cross engraved on a rock with various characters. In
Oajaca there was a cross which the Indians from time immemorial
had been accustomed to consider as a divine symbol. By
order of Bishop Cervantes it was placed in a chapel in the
cathedral. Information concerning its discovery, together with
a small cup, cut out of its wood, was sent to Rome to Paul V.,
who received it on his knees, singing the hymn <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexilla regis. etc.</span></cite></p>

<h3 class='c012'>THY AND US.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The two divisions of the Lord’s Prayer—the former relating
to the glory of God, the latter to the wants of man—appear very
evident on a slight transposition of the personal pronouns:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GOTHIC VERSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Ulphilas, who lived between the years 310 and 388, was
bishop of the Western Goths, and translated the greater part of
the Scriptures into the Gothic language. The following is his
rendering of the Lord’s Prayer:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span><span lang="got" xml:lang="got">Atta unsar thu in himinam. Weihnai namo thein. Quimai thiudinassus

<h3 class='c012'>METRICAL VERSIONS.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy kingdom come: thy will be done the same</div>
      <div class='line'>In earth and heaven. Give us daily bread;</div>
      <div class='line'>Forgive our sins as others we forgive.</div>
      <div class='line'>Into temptation let us not be led;</div>
      <div class='line'>Deliver us from evil while we live.</div>
      <div class='line'>For kingdom, power, and glory must remain</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever and for ever thine: Amen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here the sixty-six words of the original, according to the
authorized translation of St. Matthew’s version, are reduced to
fifty-nine, though the latter is fully implied in all points except
two. “This day” is omitted; but, if anything, the Greek is
slightly approached, for <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἐπιούσιον</span> refers rather to <i>to-morrow</i>
than to <i>to-day</i>. The antithesis in “<i>But</i> deliver us” does not
appear: if the word deliver be sacrificed, we may read, “But
keep us safe.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The subjoined metrical version of the Prayer is at least two
and a half centuries old, and was written for adaptation to
music in public worship:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Our Father which in heaven art,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>On earth thy will be done,</div>
      <div class='line'>Even as the same in heaven is.</div>
      <div class='line'>Give us, O Lord, our daily bread this day:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As we forgive our debtors,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So forgive our debts, we pray.</div>
      <div class='line'>Into temptation lead us not,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From evil make us free:</div>
      <div class='line'>The kingdom, power, and glory thine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Both now and ever be.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Prayer is commended for its authorship, its efficacy, its
perfection, the order of its parts, its brevity, and its necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The following paraphrase, which has been set to music as a
duet, is of more recent origin:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom Brown, in his <cite>Laconics</cite>, says that in the reign of
Charles II. a certain worthy divine at Whitehall thus addressed
himself to the auditory at the conclusion of his sermon:
“In short, if you don’t live up to the precepts of the gospel,
but abandon yourselves to your irregular appetites, you must
expect to receive your reward in a certain place, which ’tis
not good manners to mention here.” This suggested to Pope
the couplet,</p>

<p class='c013'>Dean Swift, having been solicited to preach a charity sermon,
mounted the pulpit, and after announcing his text, “He
that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord,” simply said,
“Now, my brethren, if you are satisfied with the security,
down with the dust.” He then took his seat, and there was an
unusually large collection.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>3. His exit from the world; and</div>

      <div class='line'>First, then:—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>1. Man’s ingress in life is naked and bare,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>2. His progress through life is trouble and care,</div>

  <h3 class='c012'>A SERMON ON MALT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Rev. Dr. Dodd lived within a few miles of Cambridge,
(England,) and had offended several students by preaching a
sermon on temperance. One day some of them met him.
They said one to another,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here’s Father Dodd: he shall preach us a sermon.” Accosting
him with,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your servants.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sirs! yours, gentlemen!” replied the Doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'>They said, “We have a favor to ask of you, which <i>must</i> be
granted.” The divine asked what it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To preach a sermon,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said he, “appoint the time and place, and I will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The time, the present; the place, that hollow tree,” (pointing
to it,) said the students.</p>

<p class='c000'>“’Tis an imposition!” said the Doctor: “there ought to
be consideration before preaching.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you refuse,” responded they, “we will put you into the
tree!” Whereupon the Doctor acquiesced, and asked them for
a text.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Malt!” said they.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reverend gentleman commenced:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me crave your attention, my beloved!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am a little man, come at a short warning, to preach a
short sermon, upon a short subject, to a thin congregation, in
an unworthy pulpit. Beloved! my text is ‘<span class='sc'>Malt</span>.’ I cannot
divide it into syllables, it being but a monosyllable: therefore
I must divide it into letters, which I find in my text to be
four:—<span class='sc'>M-a-l-t.</span> M, my beloved, is <i>moral</i>—A, is <i>allegorical</i>—L,
is <i>literal</i>—T, is <i>theological</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“1st. The moral teaches such as you drunkards good manners;
therefore M, my masters—A, all of you—L, leave off—T,
tippling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“2d. The allegorical is, when one thing is spoken and another
meant; the thing here spoken is Malt, the thing meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the oil of malt, which <i>you</i> rustics make M, your masters—A,
your apparel—L, your liberty—T, your trusts.</p>

<p class='c000'>“3d. The theological is according to the effects it works,
which are of two kinds—the first in this world, the second in the
world to come. The effects it works in this world are, <i>in some</i>,
M, murder—in others, A, adultery—<i>in all</i>, L, looseness of life—and
<i>particularly in some</i>, T, treason. In the world to come,
the effects of it are, M, misery—A, anguish—L, lamentation—T,
torment—and thus much for my text, ‘Malt.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Infer 1st: As words of exhortation: M, my masters—A,
all of you—L, leave off—T, tippling.</p>

<p class='c000'>“2d. A word for conviction: M, my masters—A, all of you—L,
look for—T, torment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“3d. A word for caution, take this: A drunkard is the annoyance
of modesty—the spoiler of civility—the destroyer of
reason—the brewer’s agent—the alewife’s benefactor—his
wife’s sorrow—his children’s trouble—his neighbor’s scoff—a
walking swill-tub—a picture of a beast—a monster of a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The youngsters found the truth so unpalatable, that they
soon deserted their preacher, glad to get beyond the reach of
his voice.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ELOQUENCE OF BASCOM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following passages will serve to illustrate the peculiar
oratorical style of Rev. Henry B. Bascom, the distinguished
Kentucky preacher:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Chemistry, with its fire-tongs of the galvanic battery,
teaches that the starry diamond in the crown of kings, and the
black carbon which the peasant treads beneath his feet, are
both composed of the same identical elements; analysis also
proves that a chief ingredient in limestone is carbon. Then
let the burning breath of God pass over all the limestone of
the earth, and bid its old mossy layers crystalize into new
beauty; and lo! at the Almighty <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiat</span></i> the mountain ranges flash
into living gems with a lustre that renders midnight noon, and
eclipses all the stars!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>He urged the same view by another example, still better
adapted to popular apprehension:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look yonder,” said the impassioned orator, pointing a
motionless finger towards the lofty ceiling, as if it were the
sky. “See that wrathful thunder-cloud—the fiery bed of the
lightnings and hissing hail—the cradle of tempests and floods!—What
can be more dark, more dreary, more dreadful? Say,
scoffing skeptic, is it capable of any beauty? You pronounce,
‘no.’ Well, very well; but behold, while the sneering denial
curls your proud lips, the sun with its sword of light shears
through the sea of vapors in the west, and laughs in your incredulous
face with his fine golden eye. Now, look again at
the thunder-cloud! See! where it was blackest and fullest of
gloom, the sunbeams have kissed its hideous cheek; and where
the kiss fell there is now a blush, brighter than ever mantled
on the brow of mortal maiden—the rich blush of crimson and
gold, of purple and vermilion—a pictured blush, fit for the
gaze of angels—the flower-work of pencils of fire and light,
wrought at a dash by one stroke of the right hand of God!
Ay, the ugly cloud hath given birth to the rainbow, that perfection
and symbol of unspeakable beauty!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE LORD BISHOP.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following incident is said to have occurred in the parish
church of Bradford, England, during a special service, on the
occasion of a visit from the bishop of the diocese:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The clerk, before the sermon, gave out the psalm in broad
Wiltshire dialect, namely:—“Let us zing to the praayze an’
glawry o’ God, three varsses o’ the hundred and vourteen zaam—a
varsion ’specially ’dapted to the ’caasion,—by meself:”—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE PREACHERS OF CROMWELL’S TIME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Echard says of the preachers who lived in the time of
Cromwell,—“Coiners of new phrases, drawers-out of long godly
words, thick pourers-out of texts of Scripture, mimical squeakers
and bellowers, vain-glorious admirers only of themselves,
and those of their own fashioned face and gesture; such as
these shall be followed, shall have their bushels of China
oranges, shall be solaced with all manner of cordial essences,
and shall be rubbed down with Holland of ten shillings an ell.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the singular fashions that prevailed among the
preachers of those days was that of coughing or hemming in
the middle of a sentence, as an ornament of speech; and when
their sermons were printed, the place where the preacher
coughed or hemmed was always noted in the margin. This
practice was not confined to England, for Olivier Maillard, a
Cordelier, and famous preacher, printed a sermon at Brussels
in the year 1500, and marked in the margin where the preacher
hemmed once or twice, or coughed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ORIGIN OF TEXTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The custom of taking a text as the basis of a sermon originated
with Ezra, who, we are told, accompanied by several
Levites in a public congregation of men and women, ascended
a pulpit, opened the book of the law, and after addressing a
prayer to the Deity, to which the people said Amen, “read in
the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and
caused them to understand the reading.” (Nehemiah viii. 8.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Previous to the time of Ezra, the Patriarchs delivered, in
public assemblies, either prophecies or moral instructions for
the edification of the people; and it was not until the return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, during which time
they had almost lost the language in which the Pentateuch was
written, that it became necessary to explain, as well as to read,
the Scriptures to them. In later times, the book of Moses was
thus read in the synagogues every Sabbath day. (Acts xv. 21.)
To this custom our Saviour conformed: in the synagogue at Nazareth
he read a passage from the prophet Isaiah, then closing
the book, returned it to the priest, and preached from the text.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CLERICAL BLUNDERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In an old book of Sermons by a divine named Milsom, we
are told that it is one among many proofs of the wisdom and
benevolence of Providence that the world was not created in
the midst of winter, when Adam and Eve could have found
nothing to eat, but in harvest-time, when there was fruit on
every tree and shrub to tempt the willing hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another commentator praises Divine Goodness for always
making the largest rivers flow close by the most populous towns.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Austin undertook to prove that the ten plagues of Egypt
were punishments adapted to the breach of the ten commandments,—forgetting
that the law was given to the Jews, and that
the plagues were inflicted on the Egyptians, and also that the
law was not given in the form of commandments until nearly
three months after the plagues had been sent.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PROVING AN ALIBI.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A clergyman at Cambridge preached a sermon which one of
his auditors commended. “Yes,” said a gentleman to whom it
was mentioned, “it was a good sermon, but he stole it.” This
was told to the preacher. He resented it, and called on the
gentleman to retract what he had said. “I am not,” replied the
aggressor, “very apt to retract my words, but in this instance I
will. I said, you had stolen the sermon; I find I was wrong;
for on returning home, and referring to the book whence I
thought it was taken, I found it there.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>WHITEFIELD AND THE SAILORS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Whitefield, whose gestures and play of features were so
full of dramatic power, once preached before the seamen at New
York, and, in the course of his sermon, introduced the following
bold apostrophe:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, my boys, we have a clear sky, and are making fine
headway over a smooth sea before a light breeze, and we shall
soon lose sight of land. But what means this sudden lowering
of the heavens, and that dark cloud arising from the western
horizon? Hark! Don’t you hear the distant thunder? Don’t
you see those flashes of lightning? There is a storm gathering!
Every man to his duty. How the waves rise and dash against
the ship! The air is dark! The tempest rages! Our masts
are gone. The ship is on her beam ends! What next?” The
unsuspecting tars, reminded of former perils on the deep, as if
struck by the power of magic, arose and exclaimed, “Take to
the long boat.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PROTESTANT EXCOMMUNICATION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>John Knox, in his Liturgy for Scotch Presbyterians, sets
forth the following form for the exercise of such an attribute
of ecclesiastical authority in Protestant communities as excommunication:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“O Lord Jesus Christ, thy expressed word is our assurance,
and therefore, in boldness of the same, here in thy name, and
at the commandment of this thy present congregation, we cut
off, seclude, and excommunicate from thy body, and from our
society, N. as a pround contemner, and slanderous person, and
a member for the present altogether corrupted, and pernicious
to the body. And this his sin (albeit with sorrow of our hearts)
by virtue of our ministry, we bind and pronounce the same to
be bound in heaven and earth. We further give over, into the
hands and power of the devil, the said N. to the destruction of
his flesh; straitly charging all that profess the Lord Jesus, to
whose knowledge this our sentence shall come, to repute and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>hold the said N. accursed and unworthy of the familiar society
of Christians; declaring unto all men that such as hereafter
(before his repentance) shall haunt, or familiarly accompany
him, are partakers of his impiety, and subject to the like condemnation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This our sentence, O Lord Jesus, pronounced in thy name,
and at thy commandment, we humbly beseech thee to ratify
even according to thy promise.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BAPTISMAL NAMES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A Puritan maiden, who was asked for her baptismal name,
replied, “‘Through-much-tribulation-we-enter-the-kingdom-of-Heaven,’

<p class='c000'>The following names will be found in <cite>Lower’s English Sirnames</cite>,

taken from a jury-list of Sussex County, 1658. The favorite
female baptismal names among the Puritans were Mercy, Faith,
Fortune, Honor, Virtue; but there were among them those who
preferred such high-flown names as Alethe, Prothesa, Euphrosyne,
Kezia, Keturah, Malvina, Melinda, Sabrina, Alpina,
Oriana.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EARLY PUNISHMENTS IN MASSACHUSETTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>From the early records of Massachusetts we learn that the
following singular punishments were inflicted in that colony
two hundred years ago:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Richard Salstonstall, fined four bushels of malt for his
absence from the court.</p>

<p class='c000'>Josias Plaistowe, for stealing four baskets of corn from the
Indians, to return them eight baskets again, to be fined £5, and
hereafter to be called Josias, not Mr. as he used to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thomas Peter, for suspicions of slander, idleness, and stubbornness,
is to be severely whipped and kept in hold.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Capt. Stone, for abusing Mr. Ludlow by calling him <i>justass</i>,
fined £100, and prohibited coming within the patent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Joyce Dradwick to give unto Alexander Becks 20<i>s.</i>, for
promising him marriage without her friends’ consent, and now
refusing to perform the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>Richard Turner, for being notoriously drunk, fined £2.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edward Palmer, for his extortion in taking 32<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> for the
plank and work of Boston stocks, fined £5, and sentenced to
sit one hour in the stocks.</p>

<p class='c000'>John White bound in £10 to good behavior, and not come
into the company of his neighbor Thomas Bell’s wife alone.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>VIRGINIA PENALTIES IN THE OLDEN TIME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>From the old records in the Court House of Warwick County,
Virginia, we extract some entries of decisions by the court under
date of October 21, 1663. It may be worth while to remark
that at that early period tobacco was not only a staple commodity
but a substitute for currency.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. John Harlow, and Alice his wife, being by the grand
inquest presented for absenting themselves from church, are,
according to the act, fined each of them fifty pounds of tobacco;
and the said Mr. John Harlow ordered forthwith to pay one
hundred pounds of tobacco to the sheriff, otherwise the said
sheriff to levy by way of distress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jane Harde, the wife of Henry Harde, being presented for
not ’tending church, is, according to act, fined fifty pounds of
tobacco; and the sheriff is ordered to collect the same from her,
and, in case of non-payment, to distress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“John Lewis, his wife this day refusing to take the oath of
allegiance, being ordered her, is committed into the sheriff’s
custody, to remain until she take the said oath, or until further
ordered to the contrary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“John Lewis, his wife for absenting herself from church, is
fined fifty pounds of tobacco, to be collected by the sheriff from
her husband; and upon non-payment, the said sheriff to distress.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“George Harwood, being prosecuted for his absenting himself
from church, is fined fifty pounds of tobacco, to be levied
by way of distress by the sheriff upon his non-payment thereof.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Peter White and his wife, being presented for common
swearing, are fined fifty pounds of tobacco, both of them; to be
collected by the sheriff from the said White, and, upon non-payment
of the same, to distress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Richard King, being presented as a common swearer, is
fined fifty pounds of tobacco, to be levied by the sheriff, by way
of distress, upon his non-payment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The following extracts from the laws ordained by the people
of New Haven, previous to their incorporation with the Saybrook
and Hartford colonies, afford an idea of the strange character
of their prohibitions. As the substance only is given in
the transcription, the language is necessarily modernized:—</p>

<p class='c000'>No quaker or dissenter from the established worship of the
dominion shall be allowed to give a vote for the election of
magistrates, or any officer.</p>

<p class='c000'>No food or lodging shall be afforded to a quaker, adamite, or
other heretic.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any person turns quaker, he shall be banished, and not
suffered to return, but upon pain of death.</p>

<p class='c000'>No priest shall abide in the dominion: he shall be banished,
and suffer death on his return. Priests may be seized by any
one without a warrant.</p>

<p class='c000'>No man to cross a river but with an authorized ferryman.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one shall run on the sabbath-day, or walk in his garden,
or elsewhere, except reverently to and from meeting.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one shall travel, cook victuals, make beds, sweep house,

<p class='c000'>To pick an ear of corn growing in a neighbor’s garden shall
be deemed theft.</p>

<p class='c000'>A person accused of trespass in the night shall be judged
guilty, unless he clear himself by oath.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it appears that an accused has confederates, and he
refuses to discover them, he may be racked.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one shall buy or sell lands without permission of the
selectmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>A drunkard shall have a master appointed by the selectmen,
who are to debar him the liberty of buying and selling.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whoever publishes a lie to the prejudice of his neighbor,
shall sit in the stocks or be whipped fifteen stripes.</p>

<p class='c000'>No minister shall keep a school.</p>

<p class='c000'>Men-stealers shall suffer death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whoever wears clothes trimmed with gold, silver, or bone
lace, above two shillings by the yard, shall be presented by the

estate.</p>

<p class='c000'>A debtor in prison, swearing he has no estate, shall be let
out, and sold to make satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whoever sets a fire in the woods, and it burns a house, shall
suffer death; and persons suspected of this crime shall be imprisoned

a fine of £5.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one shall read common-prayer, keep Christmas or saint-days,
make minced pies, dance, play cards, or play on any instrument
of music, except the drum, trumpet, and Jews-harp.</p>

<p class='c000'>No gospel minister shall join people in marriage; the magistrates
only shall join in marriage, as they may do it with less
scandal to Christ’s church.</p>

<p class='c000'>When parents refuse their children convenient marriages, the
magistrate shall determine the point.</p>

<p class='c000'>The selectmen, on finding children ignorant, may take them

      <div class='line'>Hard is the job to launch the desperate pun;</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>pun-job</i> dangerous as the Indian one.—<span class='sc'>Holmes.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Life and language are alike sacred. Homicide and <i>verbicide</i>—that is, violent
treatment of a word with fatal results to its legitimate meaning, which is
its life—are alike forbidden. <i>Manslaughter</i>, which is the meaning of the one,
is the same as man’s laughter, which is the end of the other.—<span class='sc'>Ibid.</span></p>

<p class='c007'>The quaint Cardan thus defineth:—“Punning is an art of
harmonious jingling upon words, which, passing in at the ears
and falling upon the diaphragma, excites a titillary motion in
those parts; and this, being conveyed by the animal spirits into
the muscles of the face, raises the cockles of the heart.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He who would make a pun would pick a pocket,” is the
stereotyped dogma fulminated by laugh-lynchers from time immemorial;
or, as the <i>Autocrat</i> hath it, “To trifle with the
vocabulary which is the vehicle of social intercourse is to tamper
with the currency of human intelligence. He who would
violate the sanctities of his mother tongue would invade the recesses
of the paternal till without remorse, and repeat the banquet
of Saturn without an indigestion.” The “inanities of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>working-day world” cannot perceive any wittiness or grace in
punning; and yet, according to the comprehensive definition of
wit by Dr. Barrow, the eminent divine, it occupies a very considerable
portion of the realm of wit. He says, “Wit is a thing
so versatile and multiform, appearing in so many shapes, so
many postures, so many garbs, so variously apprehended by
several eyes and judgments, that it seemeth no less hard to
settle a clear and certain notion thereof, than to make a portrait
of Proteus, or to define the figure of the fleeting air.
Sometimes it lieth in <i>pat allusions to a known story</i>, or in
<i>seasonable application of a trivial saying</i>, or in feigning an
apposite tale; sometimes it <i>playeth in words and phrases</i>,
taking advantage of the <i>ambiguity of their sense, or the affinity
of their sound</i>; sometimes it is wrapped in a dress of humorous
expression, sometimes it lurketh under <i>an odd similitude</i>;
sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart answer, in
a <i>quirkish</i> reason, in a shrewd intimation, in cunningly,
divertingly, or cleverly retorting an objection; sometimes it is
couched in a bold scheme of speech, in a tart irony, in a lusty
hyperbole, in a startling metaphor, in a <i>plausible reconciling
of contradictions</i>, or in <i>acute nonsense</i>; sometimes a scenic representation
of persons or things, a counterfeit speech, a mimic
look or gesture, passeth for it. Sometimes an affected simplicity,
sometimes a presumptuous bluntness, giveth it being.
Sometimes it riseth only from <i>a lucky hitting upon what is
strange</i>; sometimes from <i>a crafty wresting of obvious matter
to the purpose</i>. Often it consisteth of one knows not what,
and springeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are unaccountable
and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless
rovings of fancy and windings of language.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If this definition be true, there is truth as well as wit in the
punster’s reply to the taunt of the rhetorician that “punning
is the <i>lowest species</i> of wit.” “Yes,” said he, “for it is the
<i>foundation</i> of all wit.” But, whatever may be said of the
practice by those who affect to despise it, it has been much in
vogue in all ages. Horne, in his <cite>Introduction to the Critical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Study of the Holy Scriptures</cite>, tells us that it was a very favorite
figure of rhetoric among the Hebrews, and is yet common
among most of the Oriental nations. Professor Stuart, in his
Hebrew grammar, gives numerous examples of it in the Old
Testament, and Winer and Horne point out others in the New
Testament, especially in the writings of St. Paul. These cannot,
of course, be equivalently expressed in English.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the Greek authors exhibit a fondness for this rhetorical
figure, and some of the most excellent puns extant are to
be found in the Greek Anthologies. As a specimen, the following
is given from Wesseling’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diodorus Siculus</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Dioscurus, an Egyptian bishop, before he began the service,
had the common custom of saying <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ειρηνη πασιν</span>, (<span lang="el-Latn" xml:lang="el-Latn">irene pasin</span>,)
<i>peace be to all</i>. It was notorious that the pious churchman
had at home a favorite mistress, whose name was Irene, which
incident produced the following smart epigram:—</p>

<p class='c013'>At one time there was a general strike among the workingmen
of Paris, and Theodore Hook gave the following amusing
account of the affair:—“The bakers, being ambitious to extend
their <i>do</i>-mains, declared that a revolution was <i>needed</i>, and,
though not exactly <i>bred</i> up to arms, soon reduced their <i>crusty</i>
masters to terms. The tailors called a council of the <i>board</i>, to
see what <i>measures</i> should be taken, and, looking upon the
bakers as the <i>flower</i> of chivalry, decided to follow <i>suit</i>; the consequence
of which was, that a <i>cereous</i> insurrection was <i>lighted
up</i> among the candle-makers, which, however <i>wick</i>-ed it might
appear in the eyes of some persons, developed traits of character
not unworthy of ancient <i>Greece</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A clergyman who had united in marriage a couple whose

that they appeared both <i>annie</i>-mated and <i>bene</i>-fitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>An old writer said that when <i>cannons</i> were introduced as

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Charles Mathews, the comedian, was served by a green-grocer,
named Berry, and generally settled his bill once a quarter.
At one time the account was sent in before it was due, and
Mathews, laboring under an idea that his credit was doubted,
said, “Here’s a pretty <i>mull</i>, Berry. You have sent in your
<i>bill</i>, Berry, before it is <i>due</i>, Berry. Your father, the <i>elder</i>
Berry, would not have been such a <i>goose</i>, Berry; but you need

<p class='c000'>Turner, the painter, was at a dinner where several artists,
amateurs, and literary men were convened. A poet, by way
of being facetious, proposed as a toast, “<i>The Painters and
Glaziers of England</i>.” The toast was drunk; and Turner,
after returning thanks for it, proposed “<i>Success to the Paper-Stainers</i>,”
and called on the poet to respond.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Dr. Johnson having freely expressed his aversion to punning,
Boswell hinted that his illustrious friend’s dislike to this species
of small wit might arise from his inability to play upon words.
“Sir”, roared Johnson, “if I were punish-ed for every pun I
shed, there would not be left a puny shed of my punnish head.”
Once, by accident, he made a singular pun. A person who
affected to live after the Greek manner, and to anoint himself
with oil, was one day mentioned to him. Johnson, in the course
of conversation on the singularity of his practice, gave him the
denomination of <i>this man of Grease</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sydney Smith—so Lord Houghton in his <cite>Monographs</cite> tells
us—has written depreciatingly of all playing upon words; but
his rapid apprehension could not altogether exclude a kind of
wit which, in its best forms, takes fast hold of the memory,
besides the momentary amusement it excites. His objection
to the superiority of a city feast: “I cannot wholly value a
dinner by the test you do (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">testudo</span></i>);”—his proposal to settle the
question of the wood pavement around St. Paul’s: “Let the
Canons once lay their heads together and the thing will be done;”—his
pretty compliment to his friends, Mrs. Tighe and Mrs.
Cuffe: “Ah! there you are: the cuff that every one would wear,
the tie that no one would loose”—may be cited as perfect in
their way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admiral Duncan’s address to the officers who came on board

de Winter, was laconic and humorous: “Gentlemen, you

keep up a good fire.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE PERILOUS PRACTICE OF PUNNING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Theodore Hook thus cautions young people to resist provocation
to the habit of punning:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>My little dears, who learn to read, pray early learn to shun</div>
      <div class='line'>That very silly thing indeed which people call a pun.</div>
      <div class='line'>Read Entick’s rules, and ’twill be found how simple an offence</div>
      <div class='line'>It is to make the self-same sound afford a double sense.</div>
      <div class='line'>For instance, <i>ale</i> may make you <i>ail</i>, your <i>aunt</i> an <i>ant</i> may kill,</div>
      <div class='line'>You in a <i>vale</i> may buy a <i>vail</i>, and <i>Bill</i> may pay the <i>bill</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or if to France your bark you steer, at Dover it may be,</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>peer</i> <i>appears</i> upon the <i>pier</i>, who, blind, still goes to <i>sea</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus one might say when to a treat good friends accept our greeting,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis <i>meet</i> that men who <i>meet</i> to eat, should eat their <i>meat</i> when <i>meeting</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>Brawn on the board’s no <i>bore</i> indeed, although from <i>boar</i> prepared;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor can the <i>fowl</i> on which we feed <i>foul</i> feeding be declared.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus <i>one</i> ripe fruit may be a <i>pear</i>, and yet be <i>pared</i> again,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still be <i>one</i>, which seemeth rare, until we do explain.</div>
      <div class='line'>It therefore should be all your aim to speak with ample care;</div>
      <div class='line'>For who, however fond of <i>game</i>, would choose to swallow <i>hair</i>?</div>
      <div class='line'>A fat man’s <i>gait</i> may make us smile, who has no <i>gate</i> to close;</div>
      <div class='line'>The farmer sitting on his <i>stile</i> no <i>stylish</i> person knows;</div>
      <div class='line'>Perfumers men of <i>scents</i> must be; some Scilly men are bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>brown</i> man oft <i>deep read</i> we see—a <i>black</i> a wicked <i>wight</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>Most wealthy men good manners have, however vulgar they,</div>
      <div class='line'>And actors still the harder <i>slave</i> the oftener they <i>play</i>;</div>
      <div class='line'>So poets can’t the <i>baize</i> obtain unless their tailors choose,</div>
      <div class='line'>While grooms and coachmen not in vain each evening seek the <i>mews</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>dyer</i> who by dying <i>lives</i>, a <i>dire</i> life maintains;</div>
      <div class='line'>The glazier, it is known, receives his <i>profits</i> from his <i>panes</i>;</div>
      <div class='line'>By gardeners <i>thyme</i> is <i>tied</i>, ’tis true, when Spring is in its prime,</div>
      <div class='line'>But <i>time</i> or <i>tide</i> won’t wait for you, if you are <i>tied</i> for <i>time</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>There now you see, my little dears, the way to make a pun;</div>
      <div class='line'>A trick which you, through coming years, should sedulously shun.</div>
      <div class='line'>The fault admits of no defense, for wheresoe’er ’tis found,</div>
      <div class='line'>You sacrifice the <i>sound</i> for <i>sense</i>, the <i>sense</i> is never <i>sound</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>So let your words and actions too, one single meaning prove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, just in all you say or do, you’ll gain esteem and love:</div>
      <div class='line'>In mirth and play no harm you’ll know, when duty’s task is done;</div>
      <div class='line'>But parents ne’er should let you go un<i>pun</i>ished for a <i>pun</i>.</div>

witticism of Madame Grisi, at the time his wife, and one of
the best bits of repartee on record. Louis Phillippe, passing
through a room where Grisi stood, holding two of her young
children by the hand, said gaily: “Ah! Madame, are those,
then, some of your little <i>Grisettes</i>?” “No, Sire,” was the
quick reply, perfect in every requirement of the pun, “No,
Sire, these are my little <i>Marionettes</i>.”</p>

<p class='c018'><i>1st D.</i> Is his honor sick? Pray let us feel his pulse. It does beat very
slow to-day.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>2d D.</i> No, no, ’tis as quick as ever I felt; you may try it. Indeed, it is as

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>
  <h2 id='c182' class='c006'>English Words and Forms of Expression.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dictionary English is something very different not only
from common colloquial English, but even from that of ordinary
written composition. Instead of about forty thousand words,
there is probably no single author in the language from whose
works, however voluminous, so many as ten thousand words
could be collected. Of the forty thousand words there are
certainly many more than one-half that are only employed, if
they are ever employed at all, on the rarest occasions. We should
be surprised to find, if we counted them, with how small a
number of words we manage to express all that we have to say,
either with our lips or with the pen. Our common literary
English probably hardly amounts to ten thousand words; our
common spoken English hardly to five thousand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Odd words are to be found in the dictionaries. Why they are
kept there no one knows; but what man in his senses would use
such words as zythepsary for a brewhouse, and zymologist for a
brewer; would talk of a stormy day as procellous and himself as
madefied; of his long-legged son as increasing in procerity but
sadly marcid; of having met with such procacity from such a
one; of a bore as a macrologist; of an aged horse as macrobiotic;
of important business as moliminous, and his daughter’s
necklace as moniliform; of some one’s talk as meracious, and
lament his last night’s nimiety of wine at that dapatical feast,
whence he was taken by ereption? Open the dictionary at any
page, and you will find a host of these words.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a too ready adoption of foreign words into the currency of
the English language, we are in danger of losing much of its
radical strength and historical significance. Marsh has compared
the parable of the man who built his house upon the sand, as
given by Matthew and Luke. Matthew uses the plain Saxon
English. The learned Evangelist, Luke, employed a Latinized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>dictionary. “Now,” he says, “compare the two passages and
say which to every English ear, is the most impressive:”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall
of it.”—<cite>Matthew.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>“Against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately
it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.”—<cite>Luke.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>There can scarcely be a difference of opinion as to the
relative force and beauty of the two versions, and consequently
we find, that while that of Matthew has become proverbial, the
narrative of Luke is seldom or never quoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trench says that the Anglo-Saxon is not so much one element
of the English language, as the foundation of it—the basis.
All its joints, its whole <i>articulation</i>, its sinews and its ligaments,
the great body of articles, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions,
numerals, auxiliary verbs, all smaller words which serve to knit
together and bind the larger into sentences, these—not to speak
of the grammatical structure of the language—are exclusively
Saxon. The Latin may contribute its tale of bricks, yea, of
goodly and polished hewn stones to the spiritual building, but
the mortar, with all that holds and binds these together, and
constitutes them into a house, is Saxon throughout. As proof
positive of the soundness of the above affirmation, the test is
submitted that—“you <i>can</i> write a sentence without Latin, but
you <i>cannot</i> without Saxon.” The words of the Lord’s Prayer
are almost all Saxon. Our good old family Bible is a capital
standard of it, and has done more than any other book for the
conservation of the purity of our language. Our best writers,
particularly those of Queen Anne’s time,—Addison, Steele,
Swift, &amp;c.,—were distinguished by their use of simple Saxon.</p>

“their mutual ancestors;” “Is there anything in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tenebræ</span></i>
why I ought not to be present?”; “<i>thoughts which made him
unconscious</i> how long had elapsed;” “with no companions than
the wounded near them;” “The surgeon was sitting by her
side, occasionally wiping the slight foam from her brow.” We
have heard of people foaming at the mouth, but never before of
a lady foaming at the brow.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“YE” FOR “THE.”</h3>

<p class='c013'><i>Ye</i> is sometimes used for <i>the</i> in old books wherein <i>the</i> is
the more usual form, on account of the difficulties experienced
by the printers in “spacing out.” When pressed for room they
put <i>ye</i>; when they had plenty of room they put <i>the</i>. Many
people in reading old books pronounce the abbreviation <i>ye</i>. But
the proper pronunciation is <i>the</i>, for the <i>y</i> is only a corruption
of the old <i>thorn-letter</i>, or symbol for <i>th</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ITS.</h3>

<p class='c013'><i>His</i> is the genitive (or as we say, possessive) of <i>he</i>, (<i>he’s</i>,—<i>his</i>,)
and <i>it</i> or <i>hit</i>, as it was long written, is the neuter of <i>he</i>,
the final <i>t</i> being the sign of the neuter. The introduction of
<i>its</i>, as the neuter genitive instead of <i>his</i>, arose from a misconception,
similar to that which would have arisen had the
Romans introduced <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">illudius</span></i> as the neuter genitive of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ille</span></i>, instead
of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">illius</span></i>. <i>Its</i> very rarely occurs in our authorized version of the
Bible, <i>his</i> or <i>her</i> being used instead—occurs but a few times in
all Shakspeare—was unknown to Ben Jonson—was not admitted
into his poems by Milton—and did not come into common use
until sanctioned by Dryden.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THAT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The use of the word <i>That</i> in the following examples is
strictly in accordance with grammatical rules:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>The gentleman said, in speaking of the word <i>that</i>, <i>that that
that that that</i> lady parsed, was not <i>that that that that</i> gentleman
requested her to analyze.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now, <i>that</i> is a word that may often be joined,</div>
      <div class='line'>For <i>that that</i> may be doubled is clear to the mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>And <i>that that that</i> is right, is as plain to the view,</div>
      <div class='line'>As <i>that that that that</i> we use, is rightly used too,</div>
      <div class='line'>And <i>that that that that that</i> line has in it, is right—</div>
      <div class='line'>In accordance with grammar—is plain in our sight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>I SAY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A gentleman who was in the habit of interlarding his discourse
with the expression “I say,” having been informed by a
friend that a certain individual had made some ill-natured remarks
upon this peculiarity, took the opportunity of addressing
him in the following amusing style of rebuke:—“I say, sir, I
hear say you say I say ‘I say’ at every word I say. Now, sir,
although I know I say ‘I say’ at every word I say, still I say,
sir, it is not for you to say I say ‘I say’ at every word I say.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PATH-OLOGY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>There once resided in Ayrshire a man who, like Leman, proposed
to write an Etymological Dictionary of the English language.
Being asked what he understood the word <i>pathology</i>
to mean, he answered, with great readiness and confidence,
“Why, the art of <i>road-making</i>, to be sure.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE PRONUNCIATION OF OUGH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The difficulty of applying rules to the pronunciation of our
language may be illustrated in two lines, where the combination
of the letters <i>ough</i> is pronounced in no less than seven different
ways, viz.: as <i>o</i>, <i>uff</i>, <i>off</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>ow</i>, <i>oo</i>, and <i>ock</i>:—</p>

to have been the production of Lord Palmerston:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Alphabet rejoiced to hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Monckton Milnes was made a peer;</div>
      <div class='line'>For in the present world of letters,</div>
      <div class='line'>But few, if any, were his betters.</div>
      <div class='line'>So an address, by acclamation,</div>
      <div class='line'>They voted, of congratulation.</div>
      <div class='line'>And O U G H T and N</div>

      <div class='line'>Possessing each an interest vital</div>
      <div class='line'>In the new Peer’s baronial title.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas done in language terse and telling,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perfect in grammar and in spelling.</div>
      <div class='line'>But when ’twas read aloud—oh, mercy!</div>
      <div class='line'>There sprung up such a controversy</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>About the true pronunciation</div>
      <div class='line'>Of said baronial appellation.</div>
      <div class='line'>The vowels O and U averred</div>
      <div class='line'>They were entitled to be heard.</div>
      <div class='line'>The consonants denied the claim,</div>
      <div class='line'>Insisting that they mute became.</div>
      <div class='line'>Johnson and Walker were applied to,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sheridan, Bailey, Webster, tried too;</div>
      <div class='line'>But all in vain—for each picked out</div>
      <div class='line'>A word that left the case in doubt.</div>
      <div class='line'>O, looking round upon them all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cried, “If it be correct to call</div>

      <div class='line'>U then did speak, and sought to show</div>
      <div class='line'>He should be doubled, and not O,</div>
      <div class='line'>For sure if <i>ought</i> and <i>awt</i>, then nought on</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth could the title be but <i>Hawton</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>H, on the other hand, said he,</div>
      <div class='line'>In <i>cough</i> and <i>trough</i>, stood next to G,</div>
      <div class='line'>And like an F was then looked oft on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which made him think it should be <i>Hofton</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>But G corrected H, and drew</div>
      <div class='line'>Attention other cases to:</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Lough</i>, <i>Rough</i> and <i>Chough</i>, more than enough</div>
      <div class='line'>To prove O U G H spelled <i>uff</i>,</div>

      <div class='line'>They must pronounce the title <i>Hufton</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>N said emphatically No;</div>
      <div class='line'>For D O U G H is <i>Doh</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>And though (look there again) that stuff</div>
      <div class='line'>At sea for fun, they nickname <i>Duff</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>He should propose they took a vote on</div>
      <div class='line'>The question should it not be <i>Hoton</i>?</div>
      <div class='line'>Besides, in French ’twould have such force,</div>
      <div class='line'>A Lord must be <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haut ton</span></i>, of course.</div>
      <div class='line'>High and more high contention rose,</div>

      <div class='line'>At this atrocious pun, each page</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Of Johnson whiter grew with rage.</div>
      <div class='line'>Bailey looked desperately cut up,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Sheridan completely shut up.</div>
      <div class='line'>Webster, who is no idle talker,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made a sign signifying <i>Walker</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>While Walker, who had been used badly,</div>

<h3 class='c012'>EXCISE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following curious document gives the opinion of Lord

of the word Excise:—</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c012'>PONTIFF.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Longfellow, in his <cite>Golden Legend</cite>, thus refers to the
derivation of this word from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons</span></i> (a bridge) and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere</span></i> (to
make):—</p>

      <div class='line'>That leads from earth to heaven.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>ROUGH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Motley, in his <cite>History of the United Netherlands</cite>, IV.
138, thus ascribes the use of this word to Queen Elizabeth, of
England, in her last illness:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The great queen, moody, despairing, dying, wrapt in profoundest
thought, with eyes fixed upon the ground or already gazing into infinity
was besought by the counsellors around her to name the man to whom she
chose that the crown should devolve.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not to a Rough,” said Elizabeth, sententiously and grimly.</p>

<p class='c000'>These particulars are apparently given on the authority of
the Italian Secretary, Scaramelli, whose language is quoted in a
foot-note, and who says that the word <i>Rough</i> “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">in lingua inglese
significa persona bassa e vile</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Dickens said, “I entertain so strong an objection to
the euphonious softening of <i>ruffian</i> into <i>rough</i>, which has lately
become popular, that I restore the right word to the heading of
this paper.” (<cite>The Ruffian, by the Uncommercial Traveler, All
the Year Round.</cite>) “Lately popular” does not mean popular for
two hundred and eighty years past. A word that has escaped
the notice of the Glossarists cannot have been in use early in
the seventeenth century. That it should have been used in its
modern sense by Queen Elizabeth, passes all bounds of belief.
With all her faults she did not make silly unmeaning remarks;
and it would have been extremely silly in her to say she did not
wish a low ruffian to succeed her on the throne. If she uttered
a word having the same sound, it might possibly have been <i>ruff</i>.
The “ruff,” though worn by men of the upper class, was in
Queen Elizabeth’s time an especially female article of dress, and
the queen might have said, “I will have no ruff to succeed me,”
just as now-a-days one might say, “I will have no petticoat
government.” We want better authority than that of Scaramelli
before we can believe that Elizabeth used either the word
<i>rough</i> or <i>ruff</i>, when consulted as to her wishes respecting her
successor.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NOT AMERICANISMS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In Bartlett’s Dictionary the term “<i>stocking-feet</i>” is given as
an Americanism. But the following quotation from Thackeray’s
<cite>Newcomes</cite> (vol. i. ch. viii.) shows that this is an error:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Binnie found the Colonel in his sitting-room arrayed in what are called
in Scotland his stocking-feet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Tyndall, at the farewell banquet given in his honor
by the citizens of New York, prior to his departure, in referring
to his successful lecture-course in the United States, said he had
had—to quote his words—“what you Americans call ‘<i>a good
time</i>.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>But this expression is not an Americanism. It is used by
Dean Swift in his letter to Stella, (Feb. 24, 1710–11); “I hope
Mrs. Wells had a good time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That not very elegant adjective <i>bully</i>, though found in Bartlett,
and used by Washington Irving cannot be claimed as an
Americanism. Friar Tuck sings, in Scott’s <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come troll the brown bowl to me, bully boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come troll the brown bowl to me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But to go further back, we find it in the burden of an old
three-part song, “We be three poor Mariners,” in Ravenscroft’s
<cite>Deuteromelia</cite>, 1609:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Shall we go dance the round, the round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall we go dance the round;</div>
      <div class='line'>And he that is a bully boy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come pledge me on the ground.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One of the words which the English used to class among
Americanisms—ignorant that it was older and better English
than their own usage—was <i>Fall</i>, used as the name of the third
of the seasons. The English, corrupted by the Johnsonese of
the Hanoverian reigns, call it by the Latinism, Autumn. But
the other term, in general use on this side of the Atlantic, is the
word by which all the old writers of the language know it.
“The hole yere,” says scholarly Roger Ascham in his <cite>Toxophilus</cite>,
“is divided into iiii. partes, Spring tyme, Sommer, Faule
of the leafe, &amp; Winter, whereof the hole winter for the roughnesse
of it, is cleane taken away from shoting: except it be one
day amonges xx., or one yeare amonges xi.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>This statement, by the way, that exceptionally mild winters
were in the ratio of one to eleven, is worth noting with
reference to the recent announcement of science that the spots
on the sun have an eleven-year period of maximum frequency.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THEM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the ordinary acceptation of the words, “No love was lost
between the two,” we are led to infer that the two were on
very unfriendly terms. But in the ballad of <cite>The Babes in the
Wood</cite>, as given in Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite>, occur the following lines,
which convey the contrary idea:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No love between this two was lost,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Each was to other kind:</div>
      <div class='line'>In love they lived, in love they died,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And left two babes behind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FORLORN HOPE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Military and civil writers of the present day seem quite ignorant
of the true meaning of the words <i>forlorn hope</i>. The adjective
has nothing to do with despair, nor the substantive with the
“charmer which lingers still behind;” there was no such poetical
depth in the words as originally used. Every corps marching
in an enemy’s country had a small body of men at the head
(<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">haupt</span></i> or <i>hope</i>) of the advanced guard; and which was termed
the <i>forlorne hope</i> (<i>lorn</i> being here but a termination similar to
<i>ward</i> in <i>forward</i>,) while another small body at the head of
the read-guard was called the <i>rere-lorn hope</i>. A reference to
Johnson’s Dictionary shows that civilians were misled as early
as the time of Dryden by the mere sound of a technical military
phrase; and, in process of time, even military men forgot the
true meaning of the words. And thus we easily trace the foundation
of an error to which we are indebted for Byron’s beautiful
line:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The full of hope, misnamed <i>forlorn</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>QUIZ.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This word, which is only in vulgar or colloquial use, and
which some of the lexicographers have attempted to trace to
learned roots, originated in a joke. Daly, the manager of a
Dublin play-house, wagered that a word of no meaning should
be the common talk and puzzle of the city in twenty-four hours.
In the course of that time the letters <i>q u i z</i> were chalked on
all the walls of Dublin with an effect that won the wager.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TENNYSON’S ENGLISH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Probably no poet ever more thoroughly comprehended the
value of words in metrical composition than Mr. Tennyson, but
he has issued a new coinage which is not pure. Compound
epithets are modelled after the Greek or revived from the uncritical
Elizabethan era. Thus, where we should naturally say
“The bee is cradled in the lily,” Mr. Tennyson writes, “The bee
is lily-cradled.” When a man’s nose is broken at the bridge
or a lady’s turns up at the tip, the one is said to be “a nose
bridge-broken,” and the other (with much gallantry) to be “tip-tilted,
like the petal of a flower.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The movement of the metre again is very peculiar. Discarding
Milton’s long and complex periods, Mr. Tennyson has restored
blank verse to an apparently simple rhythm. But this
simplicity is in fact the result of artifice, and, under every variety
of movement, the ear detects the recurrence of a set type.
One of the poet’s favorite devices is to pause on a monosyllable
at the beginning of a line, and this affect is repeated so often
as to remind the reader of Euripides and his unhappy “oil
flask” in <cite>The Frogs</cite>. Take the following instances:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And the strange sound of an adulterous race,</div>

  <h3 class='c012'>“THAT MINE ADVERSARY HAD WRITTEN A BOOK.”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This passage from Job xxxi. 35, is frequently misapplied,
being interpreted as if it had reference to a book or writing as
commonly understood. It means rather, according to Gesenius,
a charge or accusation. Pierius makes it “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">libellum accusationis</span>,”
and Grotius, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptam accusationem</span>” Scott expresses
this in his <cite>Commentary</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Job challenged his adversary, or accuser, to produce a libel
or written indictment against him: he was confident that it
would prove no disgrace to him, but an honor; as every article
would be disproved, and the reverse be manifested.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Other commentators understand it as meaning a record of
Job’s life, or of his sufferings. Coverdale translates:—“And
let him that my contrary party sue me with a lybell.” In the
Genevan version it is, “Though mine adversarie should write a
book <i>against me</i>.” In the Bishop’s Bible, 1595, “Though
mine adversarie write a book <i>against me</i>.” The meaning seems
to have become obscured in our version by retaining the English
book instead of the Latin <i>libel</i>, but omitting the words in italics,
“against me.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ECCENTRIC ETYMOLOGIES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>To trace the changes of form and meaning which many of
the words of our language have undergone is no easy task.
There are words as current with us as with our forefathers, the
significance of which, as we use them, is very different from
that of their primitive use. And, in many instances, they have
wandered, by courses more or less tortuous, so far from their
original meaning as to make it almost impossible to follow the
track of divergence. Hence, it is easy to understand why it
has been said that the etymologist, to be successful, must have
“an instinct like the special capabilities of the pointer.” But
there are derivations which are only revealed by accident, or
stumbled upon in unexpected ways, and which, in the regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>course of patient search, would never have been elicited. The
following illustrative selections will interest the general reader.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Bombastic.</i>—This adjective has an odd derivation. Originally
bombast (from the Latin bombax, cotton) meant nothing
but cotton wadding, used for filling or stuffing. Shakspeare
employs it in this sense in <cite>Love’s Labor Lost</cite>, v. 2.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As bombast and as living to the time.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Decker, in his <cite>Satyromastix</cite>, says, “You shall swear not to
bombast out a new play with the old linings of jests.” And
Guazzo, <cite>Civile Conversation</cite>, 1591,—“Studie should rather
make him leane and thinne, and pull out the bombast of his
corpulent doublet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hence, by easy transition from the falseness of padding or
puffing out a figure, bombast came to signify swelling pretentiousness
of speech and conduct as an adapted meaning; and
gradually this became the primary and only sense.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Buxom.</i>—This word is simply bow-some or bough-some, <i>i.e.</i>,
that which readily bows, or bends, or yields like the boughs of
a tree. No longer ago than when Milton wrote <i>boughsome</i>,
which as <i>gh</i> in English began to lose its guttural sound,—that
of the letter <i><span lang="el-Latn" xml:lang="el-Latn">chi</span></i> in Greek,—came to be written <i>buxom</i>, meant
simply yielding, and was of general application.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——“and, this once known, shall soon return,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bring ye to the place where thou and Death</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen</div>
      <div class='line'>Wing silently the buxom air.”—<cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, II. 840.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But aided, doubtless, as Dr. Johnson suggests, by a too liberal
construction of the bride’s promise in the old English marriage
ceremony, to be “obedient and buxom in bed and board,” it
came to be applied to women who were erroneously thought
likely to be thus yielding; and hence it now means plump,
rosy, alluring, and is applied only to women who combine those
qualities of figure, face and expression.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><i>Cadaver.</i>—An abbot of Cirencester, about 1216, conceived
himself an etymologist, and, as a specimen of his powers, has
left us the Latin word cadaver, a corpse, thus dissected:—“Ca,”
quoth he, is abbreviated for caro; “da” for data; “ver” for
vermibus. Hence we have “caro data vermibus,” flesh given
to the worms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet while the reader smiles at this curious absurdity, it is
worth while to note that the word <i>alms</i> is constructed upon a
similar principle, being formed (according to the best authority)
of letters, taken from successive syllables of the cumbrous Latinized
Greek word <i><span lang="el-Latn" xml:lang="el-Latn">eleemosyna</span></i>.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Canard.</span></i>—This is the French for duck, and the origin of its
application to hoaxing is said to be as follows:—To ridicule a
growing extravagance in story-telling a clever journalist stated
that an interesting experiment had just been made, calculated
to prove the extraordinary voracity of ducks. Twenty of these
animals had been placed together, and one of them having been
killed and cut up into the smallest possible pieces, feathers and
all, and thrown to the other nineteen, had been gluttonously
gobbled up in an exceedingly brief space of time. Another was
taken from the remaining nineteen, and being chopped small
like its predecessor, was served up to the eighteen, and at once
devoured like the other; and so on to the last, which was thus
placed in the remarkable position of having eaten his nineteen
companions in a wonderfully short space of time! All this,
most pleasantly narrated, obtained a success which the writer
was far from anticipating, for the story ran the rounds of all
the journals in Europe. It then became almost forgotten for
about a score of years, when it came back from America, with
an amplification which it did not boast of at the commencement,
and with a regular certificate of the autopsy of the body
of the surviving animal, whose esophagus was declared to have
been seriously injured! Since then fabrications of this character
have been called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canards</span></i>.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span><i>Chum.</i>—A schoolboy’s letter, written two centuries ago, has
lately revealed that chum is a contraction from “chamber-fellow.”
Two students dwelling together found the word unwieldly,
and, led by another universal law of language, they
shortened it in the most obvious way.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Dandy.</i>—Bishop Fleetwood says that “dandy” is derived
from a silver coin of small value, circulated in the reign of
Henry VIII., and called a “dandy-prat.”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Dunce.</i>—This word comes to us from the celebrated Duns
Scotus, chief of the Schoolmen of his time. He was “the
subtle doctor by preëminence;” and it certainly is a strange
perversion that a scholar of his great ability should give name
to a class who hate all scholarship. When at the Reformation
and revival of learning the works of the Schoolmen fell into
extreme disfavor with the Reformers and the votaries of the
new learning, Duns, the standard-bearer of the former, was so
often referred to with scorn and contempt by the latter that his
name gradually became the by-word it now is for hopeless ignorance
and invincible stupidity. The errors and follies of a
set were fastened upon their distinguished head. Says Tyndale,
1575,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Remember ye not how within this thirty years, and far
less, and yet dureth unto this day, the old barking curs,
<i>Dunce’s</i> disciples, and like draff called Scotists, the children
of darkness, raged in every pulpit against Greek, Latin and
Hebrew?”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Eating humble-pie.</i>—The phrase “eating humble-pie” is
traced to the obsolete French word “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ombles</span></i>,” entrails; pies for
the household servants being formerly made of the entrails of
animals. Hence, to take low or humble ground, to submit one’s
self, came familiarly to be called eating “humble” or rather
“umble” pie. The word “umbles” came to us from the Norman
conquest, and though now obsolete, retains its place in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the lexicons of Worcester and Webster, who, however, explain
the entrails to be those of the deer only.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fiasco.</span></i>—A German, one day, seeing a glassblower at his occupation,
thought nothing could be easier than glassblowing,
and that he could soon learn to blow as well as the workman.
He accordingly commenced operations by blowing vigorously,
but could only produce a sort of pear-shaped balloon or little
flask (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiasco</span>). The second attempt had a similar result, and so
on, until <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiasco</span></i> after <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiasco</span></i> had been made. Hence arose the
expression which we not infrequently have occasion to use when
describing the result of our undertakings.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Fudge.</i>—This is a curious word, having a positive personality
underlying it. Such at least it is, if Disraeli’s account thereof
be authentic. He quotes from a very old pamphlet entitled
<cite>Remarks upon the Navy</cite>, wherein the author says, “There was
in our time one <i>Captain Fudge</i>, commander of a merchantman,
who upon his return from a voyage, how ill fraught soever his
ship was, always brought home his owners a good crop of lies;
so much that now, aboard ship, the sailors when they hear a
great lie told, cry out, ‘You fudge it’.” The ship was the
Black Eagle, and the time, Charles II.; and thence the monosyllabic
name of its untruthful captain comes to us for exclamation
when we have reason to believe assertions ill-founded.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Gossip.</i>—This is another of that class of words which by
the system of moral decadence that Trench has so ably illustrated
as influencing human language, has come to be a term of
unpleasant reproach. In some parts of the country, by the
“gossips” of a child are meant his god-parents, who take vows
for him at his baptism. The connection between these two actual
uses of the word is not so far to seek as one might suppose.
Chaucer shows us that those who stood sponsors for an infant
were considered “<i>sib</i>,” or kin, to each other in <i>God</i>: thus the
double syllables were compounded. Verstigan says:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Our Christian ancestors understanding a spirituall affinitie
for to grow between the parents, and such as undertooke for the
childe at baptisme, called each other by the name of <i>God-sib</i>,
which is as much as to say as that they were <i>sib</i> together, i.e.
of kin together, through God.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Roman church forbids marriage between persons so united
in a common vow, as she believes they have contracted an
essential spiritual relationship. But from their affinity in the interests
of the child they were brought into much converse with
one another; and as much talk almost always degenerates into
idle talk, and personalities concerning one’s neighbors, and the
like, so “gossips” finally came to signify the latter, when the
former use of it was nearly forgotten. It is remarkable that
the French “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commérage</span>” has passed through identically the
same perversion.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Grog.</i>—Admiral Vernon, whose ardent devotion to his profession
had endeared him to the British naval service, was in the
habit of walking the deck, in bad weather, in a rough <i>grogram</i>
cloak, and thence had obtained the nickname of <i>Old Grog</i>.
Whilst in command of the West India station, and at the height
of his popularity on account of his reduction of Porto Bello
with six men-of-war only, he introduced the use of rum and water
among the ship’s company. When served out, the new beverage
proved most palatable, and speedily grew into such favor that
it became as popular as the brave admiral himself, and in honor
of him was surnamed by acclamation “Grog.”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Hocus-pocus.</i>—According to Tillotson, this singular expression
is believed to be a corruption of the transubstantiating
formula, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc est corpus meum</span></i>, used by the priest on the
elevation of the host. Turner, in his history of the Anglo-Saxons,
traces it to Ochus Bochus, a magician and demon of
the northern mythology. We should certainly prefer the latter
as the source of this conjurer’s catch-word, which the usage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>ordinary life connects with jugglery or unfair dealing, but
preponderant evidence is in favor of the former.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Malingerer.</i>—This word, brought much into use by the exigencies
of our civil war, is from the French “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malin gré</span>,” and
signifies a soldier who from “evil will” shirks his duty by
feigning sickness, or otherwise rendering himself incapable: in
plain words, a poltroon.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Mustard.</i>—Etymologists have fought vigorously over the
derivation of this word. “Multum ardet,” says one, or in old
French, “moult arde,” it burns much. “Mustum ardens, hot
must,” says another, referring to the former custom of preparing
French mustard for the table with the sweet must of new wine.
A picturesque story about the name is thus told:—Philip the
Bold, Duke of Burgundy, granted to Dijon certain armorial
bearings, with the motto “Moult me tarde”—I long or wish
ardently. This was sculptured over the principal gate. In the
course of years, by some accident, the central word was effaced.
The manufacturers of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sinapi</span> or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">senévé</span> (such were the former
names of mustard), wishing to label their pots of condiment
with the city arms, copied the mutilated motto; and the unlearned,
seeing continually the inscription of “moult-tarde,”
fell into the habit of calling the contents by this title.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Navvy.</i>—Many persons have been puzzled by the application
of this word, abbreviated from navigator, to laborers. Why
should earth-workers be called navigators? They whose business
is with an element antipodean to water, why receive a
title as of seafaring men? At the period when inland navigation
was the national rage, and canals were considered to involve
the essentials of prosperity, as railways are now, the workmen
employed on them were called “navigators,” as cutting the
way for navigation. And when railways superseded canals, the
name of the laborers, withdrawn from one work to the other,
was unchanged, and merely contracted, according to the dislike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of our Anglo-Saxon tongues to use four syllables where a
less number will suffice.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Neighbor.</i>—Formerly this familiar word was employed to
signify “the boor who lives nigh to us.” And just here is another
of those words which have been degraded from their
original sense; for boor did not then represent a stupid, ignorant
lout, but simply a farmer, as in Dutch now.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Poltroon.</i>—In the olden days the Norman-French “poltroon”
had a significance obsolete now: days when Strongbow was a
noble surname, and the yew-trees of England were of importance
as an arm of national defence; then the coward or malingerer
had but to cut off the thumb (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pollice truncus</span>” in Latin)—the
thumb which drew the bow, and he was unfit for service,
and must be discharged.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Porpoise.</i>—The common creature of the sea, whose gambols
have passed into a jest and a proverb, the porpoise, is so named
because of his resemblance to a hog when in sportive mood.
“Porc-poisson,” said somebody who watched a herd of them
tumbling about, for all the world like swine, except for the
sharp dorsal fin; and the epithet adhered.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Scrape.</i>—Long ago roamed through the forests the red and
fallow deer, which had a habit of scraping up the earth with
their fore-feet to the depth of several inches, sometimes even of
half a yard. A wayfaring man through the olden woods was
frequently exposed to the danger of tumbling into one of these
hollows, when he might truly be said to be “in a scrape.”
Cambridge students in their little difficulties picked up and applied
the phrase to other perplexing matters which had brought
a man morally into a fix.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Sterling.</i>—This word was originally applied to the metal
rather than to a coin. The following extract from Camden points
out its origin as applied to money:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>In the time of his sonne King Richard the First, monie
coined in the east parts of Germanie began to be of especiall
request in England for the puritie thereof, and was called
<i>Easterling</i> monie, as all the inhabitants of those parts were
called <i>Easterlings</i>, and shortly after some of that countrie, skilful
in mint matters and alloies, were sent for into this realme to
bring the coins to perfection, which, since that time, was called
of them <i>sterling</i> for <i>Easterlings</i>.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Surplice.</i>—That scholastic and ministerial badge, the surplice,
is said to derive its name from the Latin “superpelliceum,”
because anciently worn over leathern coats made of hides of
beasts; with the idea of representing how the sin of our first
parents is now covered by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
so that we are entitled to wear the emblem of innocence.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Sycophant.</i>—The original etymology of the word sycophant
is curious. The word <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">συχοφαντέω</span> (from <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">σῦχον</span>, a fig, and <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">φαίνω</span>,
to show,) in its primary signification, means to inform against
or expose those who exported figs from Athens to other places
without paying duty, hence it came to signify <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">calumnior</span></i>, to
accuse falsely, to be a tale-bearer, an evil speaker of others.
The word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sycophanta</span></i> means, in its first sense, no more than
this. We now apply it to any flatterer, or other abject dependant,
who, to serve his own purposes, slanders and detracts
from others.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Tariff.</i>—Because payment of a fixed scale of duties was demanded
by the Moorish occupants of a fortress on Tarifa
promontory, which overlooked the entrance to the Mediterranean,
all taxes on imports came to be called a tariff.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Treacle.</i>—A remarkable curiosity in the way of derivations
is one traced by that indefatigable explorer, Archbishop Trench,
which connects treacle with vipers. The syrup of molasses
with the poison of snakes! Never was an odder relationship;
yet it is a case of genuine fatherhood, and embodies a singular
superstition. The ancients believed that the best antidote to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the bite of the viper was a confection of its own flesh. The
Greek word <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">θηρταχή</span>, flesh of the viper, was given first to such
a sweetmeat, and then to any antidote of poison, and lastly to
any syrup; and easily corrupted into our present word. Chaucer
has a line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Christ, which that is to every harm triacle.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Milton speaks of the “sovran treacle of sound doctrine.” A
stuff called Venice Treacle was considered antidote to all poisons.
“Vipers treacle yield,” says Edmund Waller, in a verse which
has puzzled many a modern reader, and yet brings one close to
the truth of the etymology, and shows that treacle is only a
popular corruption of <i>theriac</i>.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'><i>Wig.</i>—This word may be cited as a good example to show
how interesting and profitable it is to trace words through their
etymological windings to their original source. Wig is abridged
from <i>periwig</i>, which comes from the Low Dutch <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">peruik</span></i>,
which has the same meaning. When first introduced into the
English language, it was written and pronounced <i>perwick</i>, the
<i>u</i> being changed into <i>w</i>, as may still be seen in old English
books. Afterwards the <i>i</i> was introduced for euphony, and it
became <i>periwick</i>; and finally the <i>ck</i> was changed into <i>g</i>,
making it <i>periwig</i>, and by contraction <i>wig</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch word <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">peruik</span></i> was borrowed from the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perruque</span></i>.
The termination <i>uik</i> is a favorite one with that nation,
and is generally substituted in borrowed words for the French
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">uque</span></i> and the German <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">auch</span></i>. The French word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perruque</span></i> comes
from the Spanish <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">peluca</span></i>, and this last from <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">pelo</span></i>, hair, which
is derived from the Latin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilus</span></i>. Hence the Latin word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilus</span></i>,
hair, through successive transformations, has produced the
English word <i>wig</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Windfall.</i>—Centuries ago a clause was extant in the tenure
of many English estates, to the effect that the owners might
not fell the trees, as the best timber was reserved for the Royal
Navy; but any trees that came down without cutting were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>property of the tenant. Hence was a storm a joyful and a
lucrative event in proportion to its intensity, and the larger the
number of forest patriarchs it laid low the richer was the lord
of the land. He had received a veritable “windfall.” Ours in
the nineteenth century come in the shape of any unexpected
profit; and those of us who own estates rather quake in sympathy
with our trembling trees on windy nights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among funny instances of wresting from a text a meaning
to suit a particular purpose, is that of the classical scholar who
undertook to prove that the word “smile” was used as a euphemism
for a drink in ancient times, by quoting from Horace’s
<cite>Odes</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amara lento temperat risu.</span></div>
    </div>

<p class='c000'>Which is rendered by Martin:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Meets life’s <i>bitters</i> with a jest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And <i>smiles</i> them down.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>By <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lento risu</span></i>, it was argued, is clearly meant a <i>slow</i> smile, or
one taken through a straw!</p>

<p class='c000'>The meaning of the word <i>Wretch</i> is one not generally understood.
It was originally, and is now, in some parts of England,
used as a term of the softest and fondest tenderness. This is
not the only instance in which words in their present general
acceptation bear a very opposite meaning to what they did in
Shakspeare’s time. The word <i>Wench</i>, formerly, was not used
in the low and vulgar acceptation that it is at present. <i>Damsel</i>
was the appellation of young ladies of quality, and <i>Dame</i> a
title of distinction. <i>Knave</i> once signified a servant; and in an
early translation of the New Testament, instead of “Paul, the
Servant,” we read “Paul, the Knave of Jesus Christ,” or,
Paul, a rascal of Jesus Christ. <i>Varlet</i> was formerly used in the
same sense as valet. On the other hand, the word <i>Companion</i>,
instead of being the honorable synonym of Associate, occurs
in the play of Othello with the same contemptuous meaning
which we now affix, in its abusive sense, to the word “Fellow;”
for Emilia, perceiving that some secret villain had aspersed the
character of the virtuous Desdemona, thus indignantly exclaims:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O Heaven! that such <i>Companions</i> thou’dst unfold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And put in every honest hand a whip,</div>
      <div class='line'>To lash the rascal naked through the world.—iv. 2.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Villain</i> formerly meant a bondman. In feudal law, according
to Blackstone, the term was applied to those who held lands and
tenements in <i>villenage</i>,—a tenure by base services.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pedant formerly meant a schoolmaster. Shakspeare says in
his <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A pedant that keeps a school in the church.—iii. 2.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Bacon, in his <cite>Pathway unto Prayer</cite>, thus uses the word
Imp: “Let us pray for the preservation of the King’s most
excellent Majesty, and for the prosperous success of his entirely
beloved son Edward our Prince, that most <i>angelic imp</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>The word <i>brat</i> is not considered very elegant now, but a
few years ago it had a different signification from its present
one. An old hymn or <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De profundis</span></cite>, by Gascoine, contains
the lines,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Israel, O household of the Lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>O Abraham’s brats, O brood of blessed seed,</div>
      <div class='line'>O chosen sheep that loved the Lord indeed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a somewhat noticeable fact, that the changes in the
signification of words have generally been to their deterioration;
that is, words that heretofore had no sinister meaning
have acquired it. The word <i>cunning</i>, for example, formerly
meant nothing sinister or underhanded; and in Thrope’s confession
in Fox’s “Book of Martyrs” is the sentence, “I believe
that all these three persons [in the Godhead] are even in
power, and in cunning, and in might, full of grace and of all
goodness.” <i>Demure</i> is another of this class. It was used by
earlier writers without the insinuation which is now almost
latent in it, that the external shows of modesty and sobriety
rest on no corresponding realities. <i>Explode</i> formerly meant
to drive off the stage with loud clappings of the hands, but
gradually became exaggerated into its present signification.
<i>Facetious</i>, too, originally meant urbane, but now has so degenerated
as to have acquired the sense of buffoonery; and Mr.
Trench sees indications that it will ere long acquire the sense
of indecent buffoonery.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Frippery</i> now means trumpery and odds and ends of cheap
finery; but once it meant old clothes of value, and not worthless,
as the term at present implies. The word <i>Gossip</i> formerly
meant only a sponsor in baptism. Sponsors were supposed
to become acquainted at the baptismal font, and by their
sponsorial act to establish an indefinite affinity towards each
other and the child. Thus the word was applied to all who
were familiar and intimate, and finally obtained the meaning
which is now predominant in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Homely</i> once meant secret and familiar, though in the time
of Milton it had acquired the same sense as at present. <i>Idiot</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>from the Greek, originally signified only a private man as distinguished
from one in public office, and from that it has degenerated
till it has come to designate a person of defective
mental powers. <i>Incense</i> once meant to kindle not only anger,
but good passions as well; Fuller uses it in the sense of “to
incite.” <i>Indolence</i> originally signified a freedom from passion
or pain, but now implies a condition of languid non-exertion.
<i>Insolent</i> was once only “unusual.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The derivation of <i>lumber</i> is peculiar. As the Lombards
were the bankers, so they were also the pawnbrokers, of the
Middle Ages. The “lumber-room” was then the place where
the Lombard banker and broker stored his pledges, and <i>lumber</i>
gradually came to mean the pledges themselves. As these
naturally accumulated till they got out of date or became unserviceable,
it is easy to trace the steps by which the word
descended to its present meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Obsequious</i> implies an unmanly readiness to fall in with the
will of another; but in the original obsequium, or in the
English word as employed two centuries ago, there was nothing
of this: it rather meant obedience and mildness. Shakspeare,
speaking of a deceased person, says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How many a holy and obsequious tear</div>
      <div class='line'>Hath dear religious love stolen from mine eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>As interest of the dead.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Property</i> and <i>propriety</i> were once synonymous, both referring
to material things, as the French word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriété</span></i> does now.
Foreigners do not often catch the distinction at present made
in English between the two words; and we know a French
gentleman who, recently meeting with some pecuniary reverses,
astonished his friends by telling them that he had lost all his
“propriety.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A poet is a person who writes poetry, and, according to the
good old customs, a proser was a person who wrote prose, and
simply the antithesis of poet. The word has now a sadly different
signification; and it would not be considered very respectable
to term Addison, Irving, Bancroft, or Everett “prosers.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>INFLUENCE OF NAMES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Romans, from the time they expelled their kings, could
never endure the idea of being governed by a <i>king</i>. But they
submitted to the most abject slavery under an <i>emperor</i>. And
Oliver Cromwell did not venture to risk disgusting the republicans
by calling himself king, though under the title of Protector
he exercised regal functions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The American colonies submitted to have their commerce
and their manufactures crippled by restrictions avowedly for
the benefit of the mother-country, and were thus virtually
<i>taxed</i> to the amount of all that they in any instance lost by
paying more for some article than it would cost to make it
themselves, or to buy it of foreigners. But as soon as <i>a tax</i>
was imposed <i>under that name</i>, they broke out into rebellion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a marvel to many, and seems to them nearly incredible,
that the Israelites should have gone after other gods; and yet
the vulgar in most parts of Christendom are actually serving
the gods of their heathen ancestors. But then they do not
<i>call</i> them <i>gods</i>, but fairies or bogles, etc., and they do not
apply the word <i>worship</i> to their veneration of them, nor <i>sacrifice</i>
to their offerings. And this slight change of name keeps
most people in ignorance of a fact that is before their eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Others, professed Christians, are believed, both by others
and by themselves, to be worshippers of the true God, though
they invest him with the <i>attributes</i> of one of the evil demons
worshipped by the heathen. There is hardly any professed
Christian who would not be shocked at the application of the
word <i>caprice</i> to the acts of the Most High. And yet his
choosing to inflict suffering on his creatures “<i>for no cause</i>”
(as some theologians maintain) “except that <i>such is his will</i>,”
is the very definition of caprice.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when Lord Byron published his poem of “Cain,”
which contains substantially the <i>very same</i> doctrine, there was
a great outcry among pious people, including, no doubt, many
who were of the theological school which teaches the same,
under other <i>names</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Why and how any evil comes to exist in the universe, reason
cannot explain, and revelation does not tell us. But it does
show us what is <i>not</i> the cause. That it cannot be from <i>ill will</i>
or <i>indifference</i>, is proved by the sufferings undergone by the
<i>beloved</i> Son.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many probably would have hesitated if it had been proposed
to them to join a new <i>Church</i> under that <i>name</i>, who yet
eagerly enrolled themselves in the Evangelical <i>Alliance</i>,—which
is in fact a church, with meetings for worship, and
<i>sermons</i> under the <i>name</i> of <i>speeches</i>, and a <i>creed</i> consisting of
sundry <i>Articles of Faith</i> to be subscribed; only not called by
those <i>names</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. B. expressed to a friend her great dread of such a
medicine as tartar-emetic. She always, she said, gave her
children <i>antimonial</i> wine. He explained to her that this is
tartar-emetic dissolved in wine; but she remained unchanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. H. did not like that her daughters should be novel-readers;
and <i>all novels</i> in <i>prose</i> were indiscriminately prohibited;
but <i>any</i> thing in <i>verse</i> was as indiscriminately allowed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably a Quaker would be startled at any one’s using the
very <i>words</i> of the prophets, “Thus saith the Lord:” yet he
says the same things in the words, “The Spirit moveth me to
say so and so.” And some, again, who would be shocked at
<i>this</i>, speak of a person,—adult or <i>child</i>,—who addresses a congregation
in extempore prayers and discourses, as being under
the <i>influence of the Holy Spirit</i>; though in neither case is
there any miraculous <i>proof</i> given. And they abhor a claim
to <i>infallibility</i>; only they are <i>quite certain</i> of being under the
guidance of the Spirit in whatever they say or do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quakers, again, and some other dissenters, object to a <i>hired</i>
ministry, (in reality, an <i>un</i>hired;) but their preachers are to
be <i>supplied</i> with all they need; like the father of Molière’s
Bourgeois, who was no <i>shopkeeper</i>, but kindly chose <i>goods</i> for
his friends, which he let them have for money.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>COMPOUND EPITHETS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The custom of using hard compounds furnished Ben Jonson
opportunities of showing his learning as well as his satire. He
used to call them “words un-in-one-breath-utterable.” Redi
mentions an epigram against the sophists, made up of compounds
“a mile long.” Joseph Scaliger left a curious example
in Latin, part of which may be thus rendered into English:—</p>

The reader of Shakspeare will remember Costard’s
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">honorificabilitudinitatibus</span></i>, in Love’s Labor Lost, v. 1.
There was recently in the British army a major named <i>Teyoninhokarawen</i>.
In the island of Mull, Scotland, is a locality
named <i>Drimtaidhorickhillichattan</i>. The original Mexican for
country curates is <i><span lang="es-mx" xml:lang="es-mx">Notlazomahnitzteopixcatatzins</span></i>. The longest
Nipmuck word in Eliot’s Indian Bible is in St. Mark i. 40,

  <h3 class='c012'>THE MAD POET.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>McDonald Clarke, commonly called the <i>mad poet</i>, died a
few years ago in the Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell’s Island,
New York. He wrote those oft-quoted lines,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'>Now twilight lets her curtain down,</div>

  </div>

<p class='c000'>In his wilder moments he set all rules at defiance, and mingled
the startlingly sublime and the laughably ridiculous in the
oddest confusion. He talks thus madly of Washington:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FOOTE’S FARRAGO.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following droll nonsense was written by Foote, the dramatist,
for the purpose of trying the memory of Macklin, who
boasted that he could learn any thing by heart on hearing it
once:—</p>

<p class='c000'>So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage-leaf to make an
apple-pie; and, at the same time, a great she-bear coming up
the street pops its head into the shop—What! no soap? So he
died; and she very imprudently married the barber; and there
were present the Picninnies, and the Joblilies, and the Garyulies,
and the great Panjandrum himself, with the little round
button at top. And they all fell to playing the game of “catch
as catch can,” till the gunpowder ran out of the heels of their
boots!</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>BURLESQUE OF THE STYLE OF DR. JOHNSON.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>While I was admiring the fantastical ramifications of some
umbelliferous plants that hung over the margin of the Liffey,
the fallacious bank, imperceptibly corroded by the moist tooth
of the fluid, gave way beneath my feet, and I was suddenly
submerged to some fathoms of profundity. Presence of mind,
in constitutions not naturally timid, is generally in proportion
to the imminence of the peril. Having never learned to move
through the water in horizontal progression, had I desponded,
I had perished; but, being for a moment raised above the element
by my struggles, or by some felicitous casualty, I was
sensible of the danger, and immediately embraced the means
of extrication. A cow, at the moment of my lapse, had entered
the stream, within the distance of a protruded arm; and
being in the act of transverse navigation to seek the pasture of
the opposite bank, I laid hold on that part of the animal which
is loosely pendent behind, and is formed by the continuation of
the vertebræ. In this manner I was safely conveyed to a fordable
passage, not without some delectation from the sense of
the progress without effort on my part, and the exhilarating
approximation of more than problematical deliverance. Though
in some respects I resembled the pilot of Gyas, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jam senior
madidaque fluens in veste</span></i>, yet my companions, unlike the barbarous
Phrygian spectators, forbore to acerbitate the uncouthness
of embarrassment by the insults of derision. Shrieks of
complorance testified sorrow for my submersion, and safety was
rendered more pleasant by the felicitations of sympathy. As
the danger was over, I took no umbrage at a little risibility excited
by the feculence of my visage, upon which the cow had
discharged her gramineous digestion in a very ludicrous abundance.
About this time the bell summoned us to dinner; and,
as the cutaneous contact of irrigated garments is neither pleasant
nor salubrious, I was easily persuaded by the ladies to
divest myself of mine. Colonel Manly obligingly accommodated
me with a covering of camlet. I found it commodious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>and more agreeable than the many compressive ligaments of
modern drapery. That there might be no violation of decorum,
I took care to have the loose robe fastened before with small
cylindrical wires, which the dainty fingers of the ladies easily
removed from their dresses and inserted into mine, at such
proper intervals as to leave no aperture that could awaken the
susceptibility of temperament, or provoke the cachinnations of
levity.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—You have behaved like an impetiginous acroyli—like
those inquinate orosscrolest who envious of my moral celsitude
carry their mugacity to the height of creating symposically the
fecund words which my polymathic genius uses with uberity to
abligate the tongues of the weightless. Sir, you have corassly
parodied my own pet words, as though they were tangrams. I
will not conceroate reproaches. I would obduce a veil over the
atramental ingratitude which has chamiered even my undisceptible
heart. I am silent on the foscillation which my coadful
fancy must have given you when I offered to become your fanton
and adminicle. I will not speak of the liptitude, the ablepsy
you have shown in exacerbating me; one whose genius
you should have approached with mental discalceation. So, I
tell you, Sir, syncophically and without supervacaneous words,
nothing will render ignoscible your conduct to me. I warn
you that I will vellicate your nose if I thought your moral diathesis
could be thereby performed. If I thought that I should
not impigorate my reputation by such a degladiation. Go
tagygraphic; your oness inquinate draws oblectation from the
greatest poet since Milton, and draws upon your head this
letter, which will drive you to Webster, and send you to sleep
over it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>COWPER’S LETTER TO NEWTON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following letter was written to Rev. John Newton, by
William Cowper, in reference to a poem <cite>On Charity</cite>, by the
latter:—</p>

<p class='c000'>My very dear friend, I am going to send, what when you
have read, you may scratch your head, and say I suppose,
there’s nobody knows, whether what I have got, be verse or
not;—by the tune and the time, it ought to be rhyme; but if
it be, did ever you see, of late or of yore, such a ditty before?</p>

<p class='c000'>I have writ “Charity,” not for popularity, but as well as I
could, in hopes to do good; and if the “Reviewer” should say
to be sure, the gentleman’s muse wears Methodist shoes, you
may know by her pace, and talk about grace, that she and her
bard have little regard for the tastes and fashions, and ruling
passions, and hoydening play, of the modern day; and though
she assume a borrowed plume, and now and then wear a tittering
air, ’tis only her plan, to catch if she can, the giddy and
gay, as they go that way, by a production of a new construction;
she has baited her trap, in the hope to snap all that may
come, with a sugar-plum. His opinion in this will not be
amiss; ’tis what I intend, my principal end; and if I succeed,
and folks should read, till a few are brought to a serious thought,
I shall think I am paid for all I have said, and all I have done,
although I have run, many a time, after a rhyme, as far as
from hence to the end of my sense, and by hook or by crook,
write another book, if I live and am here another year.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have heard before of a room with a floor, laid upon springs,
and suchlike things, with so much art in every part, that when
you went in, you were forced to begin a minuet pace, with an
air and a grace, swimming about, now in and now out, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>deal of a state, in a figure of eight, without pipe or string, or
any such thing; and now I have writ, in a rhyming fit, what
will make you dance, and, as you advance, will keep you still,
though against your will, dancing away, alert and gay, till you
come to an end of what I have penned, which that you may
do, ere madam and you are quite worn out with jigging about,
I take my leave, and here you receive a bow profound, down
to the ground, from you humble me—W. C.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EXAMPLE IN IRVING’S NEW YORK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following remarkable instance of involuntary poetic
prose occurs in Knickerbocker’s humorous history of New York,
near the commencement of the Sixth Book:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The gallant warrior starts from soft repose, from golden
visions and voluptuous ease; where, in the dulcet “piping
time of peace,” he sought sweet solace after all his toils. No
more in beauty’s siren lap reclined, he weaves fair garlands
for his lady’s brows; no more entwines with flowers his shining
sword, nor through the livelong summer’s day chants forth
his love-sick soul in madrigals. To manhood roused, he spurns
the amorous flute, doffs from his brawny back the robe of peace,
and clothes his pampered limbs in panoply of steel. O’er his
dark brow, where late the myrtle waved, where wanton roses
breathed enervate love, he rears the beaming casque and nodding
plume; grasps the bright shield and ponderous lance, or
mounts with eager pride his fiery steed, and burns for deeds of
glorious chivalry.</p>

<p class='c000'>In D’Israeli’s <cite>Wondrous Tale of Alroy</cite><a id='t224'></a>, are remarkable
specimens of prose poetry. For example:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Why am I here? are you not here? and need I urge a stronger plea?
Oh, brother dear, I pray you come and mingle in our festival! Our walls
are hung with flowers you love; I culled them by the fountain’s side; the
holy lamps are trimmed and set, and you must raise their earliest flame.
Without the gate my maidens wait to offer you a robe of state. Then,
brother dear, I pray you come and mingle in our festival.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>NELLY’S FUNERAL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Horne’s <cite>New Spirit of the Age</cite>,—a series of criticisms
on eminent living authors,—we find an admirable example of
prose poetry thus noticed:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious circumstance is observable in a great portion
of the scenes of tragic power, pathos, and tenderness contained
in various parts of Mr. Dickens’s works, which it is possible
may have been the result of harmonious accident, and the
author not even subsequently conscious of it. It is that they
are written in blank verse, of irregular metre and rhythms,
which Southey, and Shelley, and some other poets, have occasionally
adopted. Witness the following description from <cite>The
Old Curiosity Shop</cite>.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>And now the bell—the bell</div>
      <div class='line'>She had so often heard by night and day</div>
      <div class='line'>And listened to with solid pleasure,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>E’en as a living voice—</div>
      <div class='line'>Rung its remorseless toll for her,</div>
      <div class='line'>So young, so beautiful, so good.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>Decrepit age, and vigorous life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And blooming youth, and helpless infancy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Poured forth—on crutches, in the pride of strength</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And health, in the full blush</div>
      <div class='line'>Of promise—the mere dawn of life—</div>
      <div class='line'>To gather round her tomb. Old men were there</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Whose eyes were dim</div>
      <div class='line in8'>And senses failing—</div>
      <div class='line'>Granddames, who might have died ten years ago,</div>
      <div class='line'>And still been old—the deaf, the blind, the lame,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>The palsied,</div>
      <div class='line'>The living dead in many shapes and forms,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the closing of this early grave!</div>
      <div class='line in4'>What was the death it would shut in,</div>
      <div class='line'>To that which still would crawl and creep above it!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Along the crowded path they bore her now;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Pale as the new-fallen snow</div>
      <div class='line'>That covered it; whose day on earth</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Had been so fleeting.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Under that porch where she had sat when Heaven</div>
      <div class='line'>In mercy brought her to that peaceful spot,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>She passed again, and the old church</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Received her in its quiet shade.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Throughout the whole of the above, only two unimportant
words have been omitted—<i>in</i> and <i>its</i>; “granddames” has been
substituted for “grandmothers,” and “e’en” for “almost.”
All that remains is exactly as in the original, not a single word
transposed, and the punctuation the same to a comma. The
brief homily that concludes the funeral is profoundly beautiful.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>Oh! it is hard to take</div>
      <div class='line'>The lesson that such deaths will teach,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>But let no man reject it,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>For it is one that all must learn</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And is a mighty universal Truth.</div>
      <div class='line'>When Death strikes down the innocent and young,</div>
      <div class='line'>For every fragile form from which he lets</div>
      <div class='line in8'>The parting spirit free,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>A hundred virtues rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>In shapes of mercy, charity, and love,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To walk the world and bless it.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Of every tear</div>
      <div class='line'>That sorrowing mortals shed on such green graves,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some good is born, some gentler nature comes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not a word of the original is changed in the above quotation,
which is worthy of the best passages in Wordsworth,
and thus, meeting on the common ground of a deeply truthful
sentiment, the two most unlike men in the literature of the
country are brought into close proximation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following similar passage is from the concluding paragraph
of <cite>Nicholas Nickleby</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The grass was green above the dead boy’s grave,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Trodden by feet so small and light,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>That not a daisy drooped its head</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Beneath their pressure.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Through all the spring and summer time</div>
      <div class='line'>Garlands of fresh flowers, wreathed by infant hands,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Rested upon the stone.</div>
    </div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>NIAGARA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The same rhythmic cadence is observable in the following
passage, copied verbatim from the <cite>American Notes</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I think in every quiet season now,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still do those waters roll, and leap, and roar,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And tumble all day long;</div>
      <div class='line'>Still are the rainbows spanning them</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A hundred feet below.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still when the sun is on them, do they shine</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And glow like molten gold.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still when the day is gloomy do they fall</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like snow, or seem to crumble away,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like the front of a great chalk cliff,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or roll adown the rock like dense white smoke.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But always does this mighty stream appear</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To die as it comes down.</div>
      <div class='line'>And always from the unfathomable grave</div>
      <div class='line'>Arises that tremendous ghost of spray</div>
      <div class='line'>And mist which is never laid:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which has haunted this place</div>
      <div class='line'>With the same dread solemnity,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Since darkness brooded on the deep</div>
      <div class='line'>And that first flood before the Deluge—Light</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Came rushing on Creation at the word of God.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To any one who reads this we need not say that but three
lines in it vary at all from the closest requisitions of an iambic
movement. The measure is precisely of the kind which Mr.
Southey so often used. For the reader’s convenience, we copy
from <cite>Thalaba</cite> his well remembered lines on Night, as an instance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How beautiful is Night!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A dewy freshness fills the silent air,</div>
      <div class='line'>No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Breaks the serene of heaven.</div>
      <div class='line'>In full orbed glory yonder Moon divine</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Rolls through the dark blue depths.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Beneath her steady ray</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The desert circle spreads,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How beautiful is Night!</div>

  <h3 class='c012'>INVOLUNTARY VERSIFICATION IN THE SCRIPTURES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The hexametric cadence in the authorized translation of the
Bible has been pointed out in another portion of this volume.
It is very noticeable in such passages as these, for example, from
the Second Psalm:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The anapæstic cadence prevalent in the Psalms is also very
remarkable:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That will bring forth his fruit in due season.—v. 6.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whatsoever he doth it shall prosper.—v. 4.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Away from the face of the earth.—v. 5.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Be able to stand in the judgment.—v. 6.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The way of th’ ungodly shall perish.—v. 7.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Couplets may be drawn from the same inspired source, as
follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Great peace have they that love thy law:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And nothing shall offend them.—Psalm, cxix. 165.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whose mind is stayed on thee.—Isaiah, xxvi. 3.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>UNINTENTIONAL RHYMES OF PROSERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The delicate ear of Addison, who would stop the press to add
a conjunction, or erase a comma, allowed this inelegant jingle
to escape his detection:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What I am going to <i>mention</i>, will perhaps deserve your <i>attention</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Whewell, when Master of Trinity College, fell into a
similar trap, to the great amusement of his readers. In his
work on <cite>Mechanics</cite>, he happened to write <i>literatim</i> and <i>verbatim</i>,
though not <i>lincatim</i>, the following tetrastich:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There is no force, however great,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can stretch a cord, however fine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into a horizontal line,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is accurately straight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>A curious instance of involuntary rhythm occurs in President
Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fondly do we hope,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Fervently do we pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>That this mighty scourge of war</div>
      <div class='line in2'>May speedily pass away:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet if be God’s will</div>
      <div class='line'>That it continue until—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>but here the strain abruptly ceases, and the President relapses
into prose.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of a discussion upon the involuntary metre
into which Shakspeare so frequently fell, when he intended his
minor characters to speak prose, Dr. Johnson observed;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Such verse we make when we are writing prose;</div>
      <div class='line'>We make such verse in common conversation.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Kemble and Mrs. Siddons, from their habit of committing
to memory and reciting dramatic blank verse, unconsciously
made their most ordinary observations in that measure. Kemble,
for instance, on giving a shilling to a beggar, thus answered
the surprised look of his companion:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is not often that I do these things,</div>
      <div class='line'>But <i>when</i> I do, I do them handsomely.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And once when, in a walk with Walter Scott on the banks of
the Tweed, a dangerous looking bull made his appearance, Scott
took the water, Kemble exclaimed:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sheriff, I’ll get me up in yonder tree.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The presence of danger usually makes a man speak naturally,
if anything will. If a reciter of blank verse, then, fall unconsciously
into the rhythm of it when intending to speak prose,
much more may an habitual writer of it be expected to do so.
Instances of the kind from the table-talk of both Kemble and
his sister might be multiplied. This of Mrs. Siddons,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When deeply in love with Miss Emily Pryne,</div>
      <div class='line'>I vowed if the lady would only be mine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I would always be ready to please her;</div>
      <div class='line'>She blushed her consent, though the stuttering lass</div>
      <div class='line'>Said never a word except “You’re an ass—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>An ass—an ass—iduous teazer!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But when we were married, I found to my ruth</div>
      <div class='line'>The stammering lady had spoken the truth;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For often, in obvious dudgeon,</div>
      <div class='line'>She’d say—if I ventured to give her a jog</div>
      <div class='line'>In the way of reproof—“You’re a dog—dog—dog—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A dog—a dog—matic curmudgeon!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And once, when I said, “We can hardly afford</div>
      <div class='line'>This immoderate style with our moderate board,”</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And hinted we ought to be wiser,</div>
      <div class='line'>She looked, I assure you, exceedingly blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>And fretfully cried, “You’re a Jew—Jew—Jew—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A very ju-dicious adviser!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Again, when it happened that, wishing to shirk</div>
      <div class='line'>Some rather unpleasant and arduous work,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I begged her to go to a neighbor,</div>
      <div class='line'>She wanted to know why I made such a fuss,</div>
      <div class='line'>And saucily said, “You’re a cuss—cuss—cuss—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>You were always ac—cus—tomed to labor!”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Out of temper at last with the insolent dame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feeling the woman was greatly to blame,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To scold me instead of caressing,</div>
      <div class='line'>I mimicked her speech, like a churl as I am,</div>
      <div class='line'>And angrily said, “You’re a dam—dam—dam—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A dam-age instead of a blessing.”</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It was the ninth year of the Trojan war—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A tedious pull at best:</div>
      <div class='line'>A lot of us were sitting by the shore—</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Upon the embers where our pork was fried,</div>
      <div class='line'>Said he would eat the onions and the leeks,</div>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE POET BRYANT AS A HUMORIST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Those who are familiar with Mr. Lowell’s <cite>Fable for Critics</cite>,
will remember the lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There is Bryant, as quiet, as cool, and as dignified,</div>
      <div class='line'>As a smooth, silent iceberg, that never is ignified,</div>
      <div class='line'>Save when by reflection ’tis kindled ’o nights</div>
      <div class='line'>With a semblance of flame by the chill Northern Lights.</div>
      <div class='line'>He may rank (Griswold says so) first bard of your nation;</div>
      <div class='line'>(There’s no doubt he stands in supreme ice-olation,)</div>
      <div class='line'>Your topmost Parnassus he may set his heel on,</div>
      <div class='line'>But no warm applauses come, peal following peal on—</div>
      <div class='line'>He’s too smooth and too polished to hang any zeal on;</div>
      <div class='line'>Unqualified merits, I’ll grant, if you choose, he has ’em,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he lacks the one merit of kindling enthusiasm;</div>
      <div class='line'>If he stir you at all, it is just, on my soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like being stirred up by the very North Pole.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Cambridge wit has either misjudged the character of
Bryant’s genius, or he has sacrificed a man to an epigram, and
subordinated fact to a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</span></i>. Though “quiet and dignified,”
Mr. Bryant possesses a rare vein of humor, but its
bubbling fancies are not generally known or suspected for
the reason that he unbends anonymously. Only one of the
diversions of his muse appears in his published works—and
that is his invocation “To a Mosquito,” which begins thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fair insect! that with thread-like legs spread out,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And blood-extracting bill and filmy wing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dost murmur, as thou slowly sail’st about,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In pitiless ears full many a plaintive thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tell how little our large veins would bleed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would we but yield them to thy bitter need.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One day, when Mr. Bryant discovered in a fresh number
of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> a so-called poem, which struck him as
uncommonly absurd, he sat down and produced a travesty of
it, which was much more effective in its ridicule than any
sharper criticism could have been made. Here are the two
in conjunction:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Betwixt this wall and that, in quest of aught</div>
      <div class='line'>To satisfy the craving of Sir Tray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prick-eared companion of her solitude,</div>

      <div class='line'>And plates of various pattern, blue or white;</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep in the void she thrust her hooked nose</div>
      <div class='line'>Peering near-sighted for the wished-for bone,</div>

      <div class='line'>Greasing its tip, but bone or bread found none</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherefore Sir Tray abode still dinnerless,</div>
      <div class='line'>Licking his paws beneath the spinning-wheel,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Meanwhile the Dame in high-backed chair reposed</div>
      <div class='line'>Revolving many memories, for she gazed</div>
      <div class='line'>Down from her lattice on the self-same path</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereby Sir Lancelot ’mid the reapers rode</div>
      <div class='line'>When Arthur held his court in Camelot,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she was called the Lady of Shalott</div>
      <div class='line'>And, later, where Sir Hubbard, meekest knight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the Table Round, was wont to pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to her casement glint the glance of love.</div>
      <div class='line'>(For all the tale of how she floated dead</div>
      <div class='line'>Between the city walls, and how the Court</div>
      <div class='line'>Gazed on her corpse, was of illusion framed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shadows raised by Merlin’s magic art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere Vivien shut him up within the oak.)</div>
      <div class='line'>There stood the wheel whereat she spun her thread;</div>
      <div class='line'>But of the magic mirror nought remained</div>
      <div class='line'>Save one small fragment on the mantelpiece,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reflecting her changed features night and morn.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>But now the inward yearnings of Sir Tray</div>
      <div class='line'>Grew pressing, and in hollow rumblings spake,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>As in tempestuous nights the Northern seas</div>
      <div class='line'>Within their cavern cliffs reverberate.</div>
      <div class='line'>This touched her: “I have marked of yore,” she said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“When on my palfry I have paced along</div>
      <div class='line'>The streets of Camelot, while many a knight</div>
      <div class='line'>Ranged at my rein and thronged upon my steps,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wending in pride towards the tournament,</div>
      <div class='line'>A wight who many kinds of bread purveyed—</div>
      <div class='line'>Muffins, and crumpets, matutinal rolls,</div>

      <div class='line'>Celestial visits, few and far between)</div>
      <div class='line'>The crust shall be for Tray, the crumb for me.”</div>
      <div class='line'>This spake she; from their peg reached straightway down</div>
      <div class='line'>Her cloak of sanguine hue, and pointed hat</div>
      <div class='line'>From the flat brim upreared like pyramid</div>
      <div class='line'>On sands Egyptian where the Pharaohs sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her ebon-handled staff (sole palfry now)</div>
      <div class='line'>Grasped firmly, and so issued swiftly forth;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet ere she closed the latch her cat Elaine,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lily kitten reared at Astolat,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slipped through and mewing passed to greet Sir Tray.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Returning ere the shadows eastward fell,</div>
      <div class='line'>She placed a porringer upon the board,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shred the crackling crusts with liberal hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor noted how Elaine did seem to wail,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rubbing against her hose, and mourning round</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir Tray, who lay all prone upon the hearth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then on the bread she poured the mellow milk—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Sleep’st thou?” she said, and touched him with her staff;</div>
      <div class='line'>“What, ho! thy dinner waits thee!” But Sir Tray</div>
      <div class='line'>Stirred not nor breathed: thereat, alarmed, she seized</div>
      <div class='line'>And drew the hinder leg: the carcase moved</div>
      <div class='line'>All over wooden like a piece of wood—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Dead?” said the Dame, while louder wailed Elaine;</div>
      <div class='line'>“I see,” she said, “thy fasts were all too long,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy commons all too short, which shortened thus</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy days, tho’ thou mightst still have cheered mine age</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This ditty sang he to a doleful tune</div>
      <div class='line'>To outer ears it sounded like a dirge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or wind that wails across the fields of death.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Ware of a visitor, he ceased his strain,</div>
      <div class='line'>But still did ply his saw industrious.</div>
      <div class='line'>With withered hand on ear, Dame Hubbard stood;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Vex not mine ears,” she grated, “with thine old</div>
      <div class='line'>And creaking saw!” “I deemed,” he said, and sighed,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Old saws might please thee, as they should the wise.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Know,” said the Dame, “Sir Tray that with me dwelt</div>
      <div class='line'>Lies on my lonely hearthstone stark and stiff;</div>
      <div class='line'>Wagless the tail that waved to welcome me.”—</div>
      <div class='line'>Here Waldgrave interposed sepulchral tones,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Oft have I noted, when the jest went round,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sad ’twas to see the wag forget his tale—</div>
      <div class='line'>Sadder to see the tail forget its wag.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Wherefore,” resumed she, “take of fitting stuff,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make therewith a narrow house for him.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Quoth he, “From yonder deal I’ll plane the bark,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>So ’twill of Tray be emblematical;</div>
      <div class='line'>For thou, ’tis plain, must lose a deal of bark,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since he nor bark nor bite shall practice more.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“And take thou, too,” she said, “a coffin-plate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be his birth and years inscribed thereon</div>
      <div class='line'>With letters twain ‘S. T.’ to mark Sir Tray,</div>
      <div class='line'>So shall the tomb be known in after time.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“This, too,” quoth Waldgrave, “shall be deftly done;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft hath the plate been freighted with his bones,</div>
      <div class='line'>But now his bones must lie beneath the plate.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Jest’st thou?” Dame Hubbard said, and clutched her crutch,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ill she brooked light parlance of the dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>But when she saw Sir Waldgrave, how his face</div>
      <div class='line'>Was all drawn downward, till the curving mouth</div>
      <div class='line'>Seemed a horseshoe, while o’er the furrowed cheek</div>
      <div class='line'>A wandering tear stole on, like rivulet</div>
      <div class='line'>In dry ravine down mother Ida’s side,</div>
      <div class='line'>She changed her purpose, smote not, lowered the staff;—</div>
      <div class='line'>So parted, faring homeward with her grief.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Nearing her bower, it seemed a sepulchre</div>
      <div class='line'>Sacred to memory, and almost she thought</div>
      <div class='line'>A dolorous cry arose, as if Elaine</div>
      <div class='line'>Did sound a caterwauling requiem.</div>
      <div class='line'>With hesitating hand she raised the latch,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on the threshold with reluctant foot</div>
      <div class='line'>Lingered, as loath to face the scene of woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>When lo! the body lay not on the hearth,</div>
      <div class='line'>For there Elaine her flying tail pursued,—</div>
      <div class='line'>In the Dame’s chair Sir Tray alive did sit,</div>
      <div class='line'>A world of merry meaning in his eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all his face agrin from ear to ear.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Like one who late hath lost his dearest friend,</div>

      <div class='line'>A clasping hand, and feels him warm with life,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so takes up his friendship’s broken thread—</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus stood the Dame, thus ran she, pattering o’er</div>
      <div class='line'>The sanded tiles, and clasped she thus Sir Tray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unheeding of the grief his jest had wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>For joy he was not numbered with the dead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Anon the Dame, her primal transports o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bethought her of the wisdom of Sir Tray,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his fine wit, and then it shameful seemed</div>
      <div class='line'>That he bareheaded ’neath the sky should go</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>While empty skulls of fools went thatched and roofed;</div>
      <div class='line'>“A hat,” she cried, “would better fit those brows</div>

      <div class='line'>And thou shalt have one, an’ my tender toes</div>
      <div class='line'>On which the corns do shoot, and these my knees</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherethro’ rheumatic twinges swiftly dart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will bear me to the city yet again,</div>

      <div class='line'>The Dragon of the great Pendragonship.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereat Sir Tray did seem to smile, and smote</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the chair-back with approving tail.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Then up she rose, and to the Hatter’s went,—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Hat me,” quoth she, “your very newest hat;”</div>
      <div class='line'>And so they hatted her, and she returned</div>
      <div class='line'>Home through the darksome wold, and raised the latch,</div>
      <div class='line'>And marked, full lighted by the ingle-glow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir Tray, with spoon in hand, and cat on knee,</div>

<h3 class='c012'>THE VARIATION HUMBUG.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The <cite>London Charivari</cite> thinks that there is more humbug
talked, printed, and practiced in reference to music than to
anything else in the world, except politics. And of all the
musical humbugs extant it occurs to Mr. Punch that the
variation humbug is the greatest. This party has not even
the sense to invent a tune for himself, but takes someone<a id='t216'></a> else’s, and
starting therefrom, as an acrobat leaps from a spring-board,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>jumps himself into a musical reputation on the strength of
the other party’s ideas. Mr. Punch wonders what would be
thought of a poet who should try to make himself renown by
this kind of thing—taking a well-known poem of a predecessor
and doing variations on it after this fashion:—</p>

<p class='c018'>There! Would a poet get much reputation for these variations, which
are much better in their way than most of those built upon tunes? Would
the poetical critics come out, as the musical critics do, with “Upon Watts’
marble foundation Buggins has raised a sparkling alabaster palace;” or,
“The old-fashioned Watts has been brought into new honor by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étincellant</span></i>
Buggins;” or “We love the old tune, but we have room in our
hearts for the fairy-like fountains of bird-song which Buggins has bid
start from it?” Mr. Punch has an idea that Buggins would have no such
luck; the moral to be deduced from which fact is, that a musical prig is
luckier than a poetical prig.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>REITERATIVE VOCAL MUSIC.</h3>

says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Who could endure to hear and sing hymns, the meaning
and force of which he really felt—set, as they frequently have
been, to melodies from the Opera, and even worse, or massacred
by the repetition of the end of each stanza, no matter
whether or not the grammar and sense were consistent with it.

</div>

<p class='c007'>Maria Edgeworth, in her <cite>Essay on Irish Bulls</cite>, remarks
that “the difficulty of selecting from the vulgar herd a bull
that shall be entitled to the prize, from the united merits of
pre-eminent absurdity and indisputable originality, is greater
than hasty judges may imagine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Very true; but if the prize were offered for a <i>batch</i> of Irish
diamonds, we think the following copy of a letter written during
the Rebellion, by S——, an Irish member of Parliament,
to his friend in London, would present the strongest claim:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“My dear Sir:—Having now a little peace and quietness, I
sit down to inform you of the dreadful bustle and confusion we
are in from these blood-thirsty rebels, most of whom are (thank
God!) killed and dispersed. We are in a pretty mess; can get
nothing to eat, nor wine to drink, except whiskey; and when
we sit down to dinner, we are obliged to keep both hands
armed. Whilst I write this, I hold a pistol in each hand and
a sword in the other. I concluded in the beginning that this
would be the end of it; and I see I was right, for it is not
half over yet. At present there are such goings on, that every
thing is at a stand still. I should have answered your letter a
fortnight ago, but I did not receive it till this morning. Indeed,
hardly a mail arrives safe without being robbed. No longer
ago than yesterday the coach with the mails from Dublin was
robbed near this town: the bags had been judiciously left behind
for fear of accident, and by good luck there was nobody
in it but two outside passengers who had nothing for thieves to
take. Last Thursday notice was given that a gang of rebels
were advancing here under the French standard; but they had
no colors, nor any drums except bagpipes. Immediately every
man in the place, including women and children, ran out to
meet them. We soon found our force much too little; and we
were far too near to think of retreating. Death was in every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>face; but to it we went, and by the time half our little party
were killed we began to be all alive again. Fortunately, the
rebels had no guns, except pistols, cutlasses, and pikes; and as
we had plenty of guns and ammunition, we put them all to the
sword. Not a soul of them escaped, except some that were
drowned in an adjacent bog; and in a very short time nothing
was to be heard but silence. Their uniforms were all different
colors, but mostly green. After the action, we went to rummage
a sort of camp which they had left behind them. All
we found was a few pikes without heads, a parcel of empty
bottles full of water, and a bundle of French commissions
filled up with Irish names. Troops are now stationed all around
the country, which exactly squares with my ideas. I have only
time to add that I am in great haste.</p>

<div class='c039'>“Yours truly, ——.</div>

<p class='c018'>“P. S.—If you do not receive this, of course it must have
miscarried: therefore I beg you will write and let me know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Miss Edgeworth says, further, that “many bulls, reputed to
be bred and born in Ireland, are of foreign extraction; and
many more, supposed to be unrivalled in their kind, may be
matched in all their capital points.” To prove this, she cites
numerous examples of well-known bulls, with their foreign prototypes,
not only English and Continental, but even Oriental and
ancient. Among the parallels of familiar bulls to be found
nearer our American home since the skillful defender of Erin’s
naïveté wrote her Essay, one of the best is an economical
method of erecting a new jail:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The following resolutions were passed by the Board of Councilmen
in Canton, Mississippi:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Resolved, by this Council, that we build a new Jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Resolved, that the new Jail be built out of the materials
of the old Jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Resolved, that the old Jail be used until the new Jail is
finished.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>It was a <i>Frenchman</i> who, in making a classified catalogue
of books, placed Miss Edgeworth’s Essay in the list of works
on <cite>Natural History</cite>; and it was a <i>Scotchman</i> who, having
purchased a copy of it, pronounced her “a puir silly body, to
write a book on bulls, and no ane word o’ horned cattle in it a’,
forbye the bit beastie [the vignette] at the beginning.” Examples
from the common walks of life and from periodical literature
may readily be multiplied to show that these phraseological
peculiarities are not to be exclusively attributed to Ireland.
But if we adopt Coleridge’s definition, which is, that “a bull
consists in a mental juxtaposition of incongruous ideas, with
the sensation, but without the sense, of connection,” we shall
find frequent instances of its occurrence among standard authors.

<p class='c000'>An Irish member of Parliament, speaking of a certain minister’s
well-known love of money, observed, “Let not the honorable
member express a contempt for money,—for if there is
any one office that glitters in the eyes of the honorable member,
it is that of purse-bearer: a pension to him is a compendium
of all the cardinal virtues. All his statesmanship is comprehended
in the art of taxing; and for good, better, and best, in
the scale of human nature, he invariably reads pence, shillings,
and pounds. I verily believe,” continued the orator, rising to
the height of his conception, “that if the honorable gentleman
were an undertaker, it would be the delight of his heart to see
all mankind seized with a common mortality, that he might
have the benefit of the general burial, and provide scarfs and
hat-bands for <i>the survivors</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The manager of a provincial theatre, finding upon one occasion
but three persons in attendance, made the following address:—“Ladies
and gentlemen—as there is nobody here, I’ll
dismiss you all. The performances of this night will not be
performed; but <i>they will be repeated</i> to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>A Hibernian gentleman, when told by his nephew that he
had just entered college with a view to the church, said, “I
hope that I may live to hear you preach my funeral sermon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An Irishman, quarrelling with an Englishman, told him if he
didn’t hold his tongue, he would break his impenetrable head,
and let the brains out of his empty skull.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear, come in and go to bed,” said the wife of a jolly
son of Erin, who had just returned from the fair in a decidedly
how-come-you-so state: “you must be dreadful tired,
sure, with your long walk of six miles.” “Arrah! get away
with your nonsense,” said Pat: “it wasn’t the <i>length</i> of the way,
at all, that fatigued me: ’twas the <i>breadth</i> of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A poor Irishman offered an old saucepan for sale. His children
gathered around him and inquired why he parted with it.
“Ah, me honeys,” he answered, “I would not be afther parting
with it but for a little money to buy something to put in it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A young Irishman who had married when about nineteen
years of age, complaining of the difficulties to which his early
marriage subjected him, said he would never marry so young
again if he lived to be as ould as Methuselah.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an Irish provincial paper is the following notice:—Whereas
Patrick O’Connor lately left his lodgings, this is to
give notice that if he does not return immediately and pay for
the same, he will be advertised.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Has your sister got a son or a daughter?” asked an Irishman
of a friend. “Upon my life,” was the reply, “I don’t
know yet whether I’m an <i>uncle</i> or <i>aunt</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was going,” said an Irishman, “over Westminster Bridge
the other day, and I met Pat Hewins. ‘Hewins,’ says I, ‘how
are you?’ ‘Pretty well,’ says he, ‘thank you, Donnelly.’
‘Donnelly!’ says I: ‘that’s not <i>my</i> name.’ ‘Faith, no more is
mine Hewins,’ says he. So we looked at each other again, and
sure it turned out to be nayther of us; and where’s the bull
of <i>that</i>, now?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“India, my boy,” said an Irish officer to a friend on his
arrival at Calcutta, “is the finest climate under the sun; but a
lot of young fellows come out here and they drink and they eat,
and they drink and they die: and then they write home to
their parents a pack of lies, and say it’s the climate that has
killed them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the perusal of a very solid book on the progress of the
ecclesiastical differences of Ireland, written by a native of that
country, after a good deal of tedious and vexatious matter, the
reader’s complacency is restored by an artless statement how an
eminent person “abandoned the errors of the church of Rome,
and adopted those of the church of England.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here is an American Hibernicism, which is entitled to full
recognition:—Among the things that Wells &amp; Fargo’s Express

fire, <i>the acts of God</i>, or of Indians, <i>or any other public enemies

<p class='c000'>George Selwyn once declared in company that a lady could
not write a letter without adding a <i>postscript</i>. A lady present
replied, “The next letter that you receive from <i>me</i>, Mr. Selwyn,
will prove that you are wrong.” Accordingly he received one
from her the next day, in which, after her signature was the
following:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“P. S. Who is right, now, you or I?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The two subjoined parliamentary utterances are worthy to
have emanated from Sir Boyle Roche:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mr. Speaker, I boldly answer in the affirmative—No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Brougham was fond of relating an instance which was
no joke to the victim of it. A bishop, at one of his country
visitations, found occasion to complain of the deplorable state of
a certain church, the roof of which was evidently anything but
water-tight; after rating those concerned for their neglect, his
lordship finished by declaring emphatically that he would not
visit the <i>damp old church</i> again until it was put in decent
order. His horror may be imagined when he discovered himself
reported in the local journal as having declared: “I shall
not visit this damned old church again.” The bishop lost no
time in calling the editor’s attention to the mistake; whereupon
that worthy set himself right with his readers by stating that
he willingly gave publicity to his lordship’s explanation, but he
had every confidence in the accuracy of his reporter. The
editor of an evening paper could hardly have had similar confidence
in his subordinate when the latter caused his journal to
record that a prisoner had been sentenced to “four months imprisonment
in the House of Commons!” In this case, we
fancy the reporter must have been in the same exhilarated condition
as his American brother, who ended his account of a city
banquet with the frank admission: “It is not distinctly remembered
by anybody present who made the last speech!”</p>

<p class='c000'>In a poem on the “Milton Gallery,” by Amos Cottle, the

      <div class='line'>“The lubber fiend outstretched the chimney near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or sad Ulysses on the larboard Steer.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Ulysses steered to the larboard to shun Charybdis, but the
compositor makes him get upon the back of the bullock, the left
one in the drove! After all, however, he only interprets the
text literally. “Steer,” as a substantive, has no other meaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>than bullock. The substantive of the verb “to steer” is steerage.
“He that hath the steerage of my course,” says Shakspeare.
The compositor evidently understood that Ulysses rode an ox;
he would hardly else have spelt Steer with a capital S.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following paragraphs, intended to have been printed
separately, in a Paris evening paper, were by some blunder so
arranged that they read consecutively:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Doctor X. has been appointed head physician to the Hospital
de la Charite. Orders have been issued by the authorities for
the immediate extension of the Cemetery of Mont Parnasse.
The works are being executed with the utmost dispatch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old story of Dr. Mudge furnishes one of the most
curious cases of typographical accident on record. The Doctor
had been presented with a gold-headed cane, and the same week
a patent pig-killing and sausage-making machine had been tried
at a factory in the place of which he was pastor. The writer
of a report of the presentation, and a description of the
machine, for the local paper, is thus made to “mix things miscellaneously:”—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The inconsiderate Caxtonian who made up the forms of the
paper, got the two locals mixed up in a frightful manner; and
when we went to press, something like this was the appalling
result: Several of the Rev. Dr. Mudge’s friends called upon
him yesterday, and after a brief conversation, the unsuspicious
pig was seized by the hind legs, and slid along a beam until he
reached the hot water tank. His friends explained the object
of their visit, and presented him with a very handsome gold-headed
butcher, who grabbed him by the tail, swung him
round, slit his throat from ear to ear, and in less than a minute
the carcass was in the water. Thereupon he came forward, and
said that there were times when the feelings overpowered one;
and for that reason he would not attempt to do more than
thank those around him for the manner in which such a huge
animal was cut into fragments was simply astonishing. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>Doctor concluded his remarks when the machine seized him,
and in less time than it takes to write it, the pig was cut into
fragments and worked up into delicious sausages. The occasion
will long be remembered by the Doctor’s friends as one of the
most delightful of their lives. The best pieces can be procured
for tenpence a pound; and we are sure that those who have
sat so long under his ministry will rejoice that he has been
treated so handsomely.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Prior of the Dominican Monastery of Voreppe, in France,
recently received the following telegram:—“Father Ligier is
dead (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">est mort</span></i>); we shall arrive by train to-morrow, at three.—<span class='sc'>Laboree</span>.”
The ecclesiastic, being convinced that the deceased,
who was highly esteemed in the locality, had selected it for his
last resting-place, made every preparation. A grave was dug, a
hearse provided, and with the monks, a sorrowing crowd waited
at the station for the train. It arrived, and, to the astonishment
of every one, the supposed defunct alighted, well and
hearty. The matter was soon explained. The reverend father,
returning from a visit to Rome, where he had been accompanied
by the priest Laboree, stopped to visit some monks at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne,
and requested his companion to telegraph
the return to his monastery. The message sent was: “Father
Ligier and I (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et moi</span></i>) will arrive,” &amp;c. The clerks inadvertently

hundred barrels <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</span></i> Simmons.” Mr. Simmons was the agent
of the Cincinnati house. The telegraph ran the last two
words together, and shortly after, the firm were astonished to
find delivered at their store one hundred barrels of persimmons.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>“SERIAL” INCONSISTENCY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Mrs. Oliphant’s interesting story of “Ombra,” there is a
curious contradiction between the end of Chapter XLV. and
the beginning of Chapter XLVI. A domestic picture is given,
an interior, with the characters thus disposed:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“One evening, when Kate was at home, and, as usual, abstracted
over a book in a corner; when the Berties were in full
possession, one bending over Ombra at the piano, one talking
earnestly to her mother, Francesca suddenly threw the door
open, with a vehemence quite unusual to her, and without a
word of warning—without even the announcement of his name
to put them on their guard—Mr. Courtenay walked into the
room.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus ends Chapter XLV., and thus opens Chapter XLVI.:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The scene which Mr. Courtenay saw when he walked in
suddenly to Mrs. Anderson’s drawing-room, was one so different
in every way from what he had expected that he was for the
first moment as much taken aback as any of the company.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The drawing-room, which looked out on the Lung’
Arno, was not small, but it was rather low—not much more
than an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entresol</span></i>. There was a bright wood-fire on the hearth,
and near it, with a couple of candles on a small table by her
side, sat Kate, distinctly isolated from the rest, and working
diligently, scarcely raising her eyes from her needle-work. The
centre-table was drawn a little aside, for Ombra had found it too
warm in front of the fire; and about this the other four were
grouped—Mrs. Anderson, working too, was talking to one of
the young men; the other was holding silk, which Ombra was
winding; a thorough English domestic party—such a family
group as should have gladdened virtuous eyes to see. Mr.
Courtenay looked at it with indescribable surprise.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MISTAKES OF MISAPPREHENSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Soon after Louis XIV. appointed Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux,
he inquired how the citizens liked their new Bishop, to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>they answered, doubtfully: “Pretty well.” “But,” asked his
Majesty, “what fault do you find with him?” “To say the
truth,” they replied, “we should have preferred a Bishop who
had finished his education; for, whenever we wait upon him,
we are told that he is at his studies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There lived in the west of England, a few years since, an
enthusiastic geologist, who was presiding judge of the Quarter
Sessions. A farmer, who had seen him presiding on the bench,
overtook him shortly afterwards, while seated by the roadside
on a heap of stones, which he was busily breaking in search of
fossils. The farmer reined up his horse, gazed at him for a
minute, shook his head in commiseration of the mutability of
human things, then exclaimed, in mingled tones of pity and
surprise: “What, your Honor! be you come to this a’ ready?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Cottle, in his <cite>Life of Coleridge</cite>, relates an essay at grooming
on the part of that poet and Wordsworth. The servants being
absent, the poets had attempted to stable their horse, and were
almost successful. With the collar, however, a difficulty arose.
After Wordsworth had relinquished as impracticable the effort
to get it over the animal’s head, Coleridge tried his hand, but
showed no more grooming skill than his predecessor; for, after
twisting the poor horse’s neck almost to strangulation, and to
the great danger of his eyes, he gave up the useless task, pronouncing
that the horse’s head must have grown (gout or
dropsy) since the collar was put on, for he said it was downright
impossibility for such a huge <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os frontis</span></i> to pass through so
narrow a collar! Just at this moment a servant girl came up,
and turning the collar upside down, slipped it off without
trouble, to the great humility and wonderment of the poets, who
were each satisfied afresh that there were heights of knowledge
to which they had not attained.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BLUNDERS OF TRANSLATORS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A most entertaining volume might be made from the amusing
and often absurd blunders perpetrated by translators. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>instance, Miss Cooper tells us that the person who first rendered
her father’s novel, “The Spy,” into the French tongue, among
other mistakes, made the following:—Readers of the Revolutionary
romance will remember that the residence of the Wharton
family was called “The Locusts.” The translator referred
to his dictionary, and found the rendering of the word to be
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Sauterelles</span></i>, “The Grasshoppers.” But when he found
one of the dragoons represented as tying his horse to one of
the locusts on the lawn, it would appear as if he might have
been at fault. Nothing daunted, however, but taking it for
granted that American grasshoppers must be of gigantic dimensions,
he gravely informs his readers that the cavalryman
secured his charger by fastening the bridle to one of the grasshoppers
before the door, apparently standing there for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much laughter has deservedly been raised at French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateurs</span></i>
who professed to be “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doctus utriusque linguæ</span></i>.” Cibber’s
play of “Love’s Last Shift” was translated by a Frenchman
who spoke “Inglees” as “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Dernière Chemise de l’Amour</span></i>;”
Congreve’s “Mourning Bride,” by another, as “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Epouse du
Matin</span></i>;” and a French scholar recently included among his
catalogue of works on natural history the essay on “Irish Bulls,”
by the Edgeworths. Jules Janin, the great critic, in his translation
of “Macbeth,” renders “Out, out, brief candle!” as
“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sortez, chandelle</span></i>.” And another, who <i>traduced</i> Shakspeare,
commits an equally amusing blunder in rendering Northumberland’s
famous speech in “Henry IV.” In the passage</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</div>
      <div class='line'>So dull, so dead in look, <i>so woe-begone</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>the words italicized are rendered, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ainsi douleur! va-t’en!</span></i>”—“so
grief, be off with you!” Voltaire did no better with his
translations of several of Shakspeare’s plays; in one of which
the “myriad-minded” makes a character renounce all claim to a
doubtful inheritance, with an avowed resolution to <i>carve</i> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>himself a fortune with his sword. Voltaire put it in French,
which, retranslated, reads, “What care I for lands? With my
sword I will make a fortune cutting meat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The late centennial celebration of Shakspeare’s birthday in
England called forth numerous publications relating to the
works and times of the immortal dramatist. Among them was
a new translation of “Hamlet,” by the Chevalier de Chatelain,
who also translated Halleck’s “Alnwick Castle,” “Burns,” and
“Marco Bozzaris.” Our readers are, of course, familiar with
the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable</div>
      <div class='line'>Seem to me all the uses of this world!</div>
      <div class='line'>Fie on’t! Oh, fie! ’tis an unweeded garden</div>
      <div class='line'>That grows to seed; things rank, and gross in nature,</div>
      <div class='line'>Possess it merely.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The chevalier, less successful with the English than with the
modern American poet, thus renders them into French:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fi donc! fi donc! Ces jours qu’on nous montrons superbes</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sont un vilain jardin rempli de folles herbes,</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui donnent de l’ivraie, et certes rien de plus</span></i></div>
      <div class='line'><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si ce n’est les engines du cholera-morbus.</span></i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Some of the funniest mistranslations on record have been
bequeathed by Victor Hugo. Most readers will remember his
rendering of a peajacket as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paletot a la purée de pois</span></i>, and of
the Frith of Forth as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cinquième de le quatrième</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French translator of one of Sir Walter Scott’s novels,
knowing nothing of that familiar name for toasted cheese,
“a Welsh rabbit,” rendered it literally by “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un lapin du pays
de Galles</span></i>,” or a rabbit of Wales, and then informed his readers
in a foot-note that the lapins or rabbits of Wales have a very
superior flavor, and are very tender, which cause them to be in
great request in England and Scotland. A writer in the
Neapolitan paper, <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Giornale della due Sicilie</span></cite>, was more
ingenuous. He was translating from an English paper the
account of a man who killed his wife by striking her with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>poker; and at the end of his story the honest journalist, with
a modesty unusual in his craft, said, “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non sappiamo per certo
se questo pokero Inglese sia uno strumento domestico o bensi
chirurgico</span></i>”—“We are not quite certain whether this English
poker [<i>pokero</i>] be a domestic or surgical instrument.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the famous Tichborne trial, the claimant,
when asked the meaning of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">laus Deo semper</span></i>, said it meant
“the laws of God forever, or permanently.” An answer not
less ludicrous was given by a French Sir Roger, who, on
being asked to translate <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">numero Deus impare gaudet</span></i>, unhesitatingly
replied, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le numéro deux se réjouit d’être impair</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the translations of the Italian operas in the
librettos, which are sold to the audience, are ludicrous enough.
Take, for instance, the lines in <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Roberto il diavolo</span></i>,—</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='c266' class='c006'>Misquotations.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In Mr Collins’ account of Homer’s Iliad, in Blackwood’s
<cite>Ancient Classics for English Readers</cite>, occurs the following:—</p>

<p class='c018'>... “The spirit horsemen who rallied the Roman line in the
great fight with the Latins at Lake Regillus, the shining stars
who lighted the sailors on the stormy Adriatic, and gave their
names to the ship in which St. Paul was cast away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If the reader will take the trouble to refer to the <cite>Acts of the
Apostles</cite>, xxviii. 11. he will find, that the ship of Alexandria,
“whose sign was Castor and Pollux,” was not the vessel in
which St. Paul was shipwrecked near Malta, but the ship in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>which he safely voyaged from the island of “the barbarous
people” to Puteoli for Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>The misquotations of Sir Walter Scott have frequently attracted
attention. One of the most unpardonable occurs in
<cite>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</cite>, chapter xlvii.:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The least of these considerations always inclined Butler to
measures of conciliation, in so far as he could accede to them,
without compromising principle; and thus our simple and unpretending
heroine had the merit of those peacemakers, to whom
it is pronounced as a benediction, that they shall <i>inherit the
earth</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On turning to the gospel of Matthew, v. 9, we find that the
benediction pronounced upon the <i>peacemakers</i> was that “they
shall be called the children of God.” It is the meek who are to
“inherit the earth,” (ver. 5).</p>

<p class='c000'>Another of Scott’s blunders occurs in <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>. The date
of this story “refers to a period towards the end of the reign
of Richard I.” (chap. i.) Richard died in 1199. Nevertheless,
Sir Walter makes the disguised Wamba style himself “a
poor brother of the Order of St. Francis,” although the Order
was not founded until 1210, and, of course, the saintship of
the founder had a still later date.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again in <cite>Waverley</cite> (chap. xii.) he puts into the mouth of
Baron Bradwardine the words “nor would I utterly accede to
the objurgation of the <i>younger Plinius</i> in the fourteenth book
of his <cite>Historia Naturalis</cite>.” The great Roman naturalist whose
thirty-seven books on Natural History were written eighteen
centuries ago, was the <i>Elder</i> Pliny.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alison, in his <cite>History of Europe</cite>, speaks of the Grand Duke
Constantine of Russia, the Viceroy of Poland, as the son of
the emperor Paul I. and the celebrated empress Catherine.
This Catherine was the <i>mother</i> of Paul, and wife of Peter III.,
Paul’s father. Constantine’s mother, i.e. Paul’s wife, was a
princess of Würtemberg.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Another of Archibald’s singular errors is his translation of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit du timbre</span></i> (stamp duty) into “timber duties.” This is about
as sensible as his quoting with approbation from De Tocqueville
the false and foolish assertion that the American people are
“regardless of historical records or monuments,” and that future
historians will be obliged “to write the history of the present
generation from the archives of other lands.” Such ignorance
of American scholarship and research and of the vigorous
vitality of American Historical Societies, is unpardonable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disraeli thus refers to a curious blunder in Nagler’s <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Künstler-Lexicon</span></cite>,
concerning the artist Cruikshank:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years ago the relative merits of George Cruikshank
and his brother were contrasted in an English Review, and
George was spoken of as “the real Simon Pure”—the first
who had illustrated “Scenes of Life in London.” Unaware of
the real significance of a quotation which has become proverbial
among us, the German editor begins his memoir of Cruikshank
by gravely informing us that he is an English artist
“whose real name is Simon Pure!” Turning to the artists under
letter P. we accordingly read, “Pure (Simon), the real
name of the celebrated caricaturist, George Cruikshank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This will remind some of our readers of the index which refers
to Mr. Justice Best. A searcher after something or other,
running his eye down the index through letter B, arrived at the
reference “Best—Mr. Justice—his great mind.” Desiring to
be better acquainted with the particulars of this assertion, he
turned to the page referred to, and there found, to his entire
satisfaction, “Mr. Justice Best said he had a great mind to
commit the witness for prevarication.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the fourth canto of <cite>Don Juan</cite>, stanza CX., Byron says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh, darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,</div>
      <div class='line'>As some one somewhere sings about the sky.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Byron was mistaken in thinking his quotation referred to the
sky. The line is in Southey’s <cite>Madoc</cite>, canto V., and describes
fish. A note intimates that dolphins are meant.</p>

the publication (as genuine and authentic) of the Letter of
Lentulus (the Proconsul of Jerusalem) to the Roman Senate,
describing the person and manners of our Lord, and for which,

<h3 class='c012'>A CLEVER HOAX ON SIR WALTER SCOTT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following passage occurs in one of Sir Walter Scott’s
letters to Southey, written in September, 1810:—</p>

<p class='c018'>A witty rogue, the other day, who sent me a letter subscribed
“Detector,” proved me guilty of stealing a passage from one
of Vida’s Latin poems, which I had never seen or heard of;
yet there was so strong a general resemblance as fairly to
authorize “Detector’s” suspicion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lockhart remarks thereupon:—</p>

<p class='c018'>The lines of Vida which “Detector” had enclosed to Scott,
as the obvious original of the address to “Woman,” in <cite>Marmion</cite>,
closing with—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When pain and anguish wring the brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>A ministering angel thou!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>end as follows: and it must be owned that if Vida had really
written them, a more extraordinary example of casual coincidence
could never have been pointed out.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“Detector’s” reference is Vida <i>ad Eranen</i>, El. ii. v. 21; but
it is almost needless to add there are no such lines, and no piece
bearing such a title in Vida’s works.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was afterwards ascertained that the waggish author of this
hoax was a Cambridge scholar named Drury.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE MOON HOAX.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The authorship of the “Moon Hoax,” an elaborate description
(which was first printed in the New York <cite>Sun</cite>) of men,
animals, &amp;c., purporting to have been discovered in the moon
by Sir John Herschel, is now disputed. Until recently it was
conceded to R. A. Locke, now dead; but in the <cite>Budget of Paradoxes</cite>,
by Professor De Morgan, the authorship is confidently
ascribed to M. Nicollet, a French savant, once well known in
this country, and employed by the government in the scientific
exploration of the West. He died in the government service.
Professor De Morgan writes as follows:—“There is no doubt
that it (the ‘Moon Hoax’) was produced in the United States
by M. Nicollet, an astronomer of Paris, and a fugitive of some
kind. About him I have heard two stories. First, that he
fled to America with funds not his own, and that this book
was a mere device to raise the wind. Secondly, that he was a
<i>protegé</i> of Laplace, and of the Polignac party, and also an outspoken
man. The moon story was written and sent to France,
with the intention of entrapping M. Arago—Nicollet’s especial
foe—in the belief of it.” It seems not to have occurred
to the sage and critical professor that a man who could
steal funds, would have little scruple about stealing a literary
production. It is, hence, more than probable that Nicollet
translated the article immediately after its appearance in
the New York <cite>Sun</cite>, and afterwards sent it to France as his
own.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>A LITERARY SELL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A story is told in literary circles in New York of an enthusiastic
Carlyle Club of ladies and gentlemen of Cambridge and
Boston, who meet periodically to read their chosen prophet and
worship at his shrine. One of them, not imbued with sufficient
reverence to teach him better, feloniously contrived to
have the reader on a certain evening insert something of his
own composition into the reading, as though it came from the
printed page and Carlyle’s hand. The interpolation was as
follows:—“Word-spluttering organisms, in whatever place—not
with Plutarchean comparison, apologies, nay rather, without
any such apologies—but born into the world to say the thought
that is in them—antiphoreal, too, in the main—butchers,
bakers, and candlestick-makers; men, women, pedants. Verily,
with you, too, it’s now or never.” This paragraph produced
great applause among the devotees of Carlyle. The leader
of the Club especially, a learned and metaphysical pundit,
who is the great American apostle of Carlyle, said nothing
Carlyle had ever written was more representative and happy.
The actual author of it attempted to ask some questions
about it, and elicit explanations. These were not wanting,
and, where they failed, the stupidity of the questioner was the
substitute presumption, delicately hinted. It reminds us of
Dr. Franklin’s incident in his life of Abraham, which he used
to read off with great gravity, apparently from an open Bible,
though actually from his own memory. This parable is probably
the most perfect imitation of Scripture style extant.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MRS. HEMANS’s “FORGERIES.”</h3>

<p class='c013'>A gentleman having requested Mrs. Hemans to furnish him

of calling her “forgeries.” The mystification succeeded completely,

<h3 class='c012'>SHERIDAN’S GREEK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In <cite>Anecdotes of Impudence</cite>, we find this curious story:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Belgrave having clenched a speech in the House of Commons
with a long Greek quotation, Sheridan, in reply, admitted
the force of the quotation so far as it went; “but” said he, “if
the noble Lord had proceeded a little farther, and completed
the passage, he would have seen that it applied the other way!”
Sheridan then spouted something <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ore rotundo</span></i>, which had all the
ais, ois, kons, and kois that give the world assurance of a Greek
quotation: upon which Lord Belgrave very promptly and handsomely
complimented the honorable member on his readiness of
recollection, and frankly admitted that the continuation of the
passage had the tendency ascribed to it by Mr. Sheridan, and
that he had overlooked it at the moment when he gave his
quotation. On the breaking up of the House, Fox, who piqued
himself on having some Greek, went up to Sheridan, and said,
“Sheridan, how came you to be so ready with that passage? It
certainly is as you state, but I was not aware of it before you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>quoted it.” It is unnecessary to observe that there was no
Greek at all in Sheridan’s impromptu.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BALLAD LITERATURE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>John Hill Burton, in his <cite>Book Hunter</cite>, after speaking of the
success with which Surtus imposed upon Sir Walter Scott the
spurious ballad of the <cite>Death of Featherstonhaugh</cite>, which has a
place in the <cite>Border Minstrelsy</cite>, says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Altogether, such affairs create an unpleasant uncertainty about
the paternity of that delightful department of literature—our
ballad poetry. Where next are we to be disenchanted? Of the
way in which ballads have come into existence, there is one sad
example within my own knowledge. Some mad young wags,
wishing to test the critical powers of an experienced collector,
sent him a new-made ballad, which they had been enabled to
secure only in a fragmentary form. To the surprise of its fabricator,
it was duly printed; but what naturally raised his surprise
to astonishment, and revealed to him a secret, was, that it was
no longer a fragment, but a complete ballad,—the collector, in
the course of his industrious inquiries among the peasantry,
having been so fortunate as to recover the missing fragments!
It was a case where neither could say anything to the other,
though Cato might wonder, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod non rideret haruspex,
haruspicem cum vidisset</span></i>. This ballad has been printed in
more than one collection, and admired as an instance of the
inimitable simplicity of the genuine old versions!</p>

<p class='c000'>Psalmanazar exceeded in powers of deception any of the
great impostors of learning. His island of Formosa was an illusion
eminently bold, and maintained with as much felicity as
erudition; and great must have been that erudition which could
form a pretended language and its grammar, and fertile the
genius which could invent the history of an unknown people.
The deception was only satisfactorily ascertained by his own penitential
confession; he had defied and baffled the most learned.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>FRANKLIN’S PARABLE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Franklin frequently read for the entertainment of company,
apparently from an open Bible, but actually from memory,
the following chapter in favor of religious toleration, pretendedly
quoted from the Book of Genesis. This story of Abraham and
the idolatrous traveler was given by Franklin to Lord Kaimes
as a “Jewish Parable on Persecution,” and was published by
Kaimes in his <cite>Sketches of the History of Man</cite>. It is traced,
not to a Hebrew author, but to a Persian apologue. Bishop
Heber, in referring to the charge of plagiarism raised against
Franklin, says that while it cannot be proved that he gave it to
Lord Kaimes as his own composition, it is “unfortunate for him
that his correspondent evidently appears to have regarded it as
his composition; that it had been published as such in all the
editions of Franklin’s collected works; and that, with all Franklin’s
abilities and amiable qualities, there was a degree of quackery
in his character which, in this instance as well as that of his
professional epitaph on himself, has made the imputation of such
a theft more readily received against him, than it would have
been against most other men of equal eminence.”</p>

<p class='c018'>1. And it came to pass after those things, that Abraham sat in the door
of his tent, about the going down of the sun.</p>

<p class='c018'>2. And behold a man, bowed with age, came from the way of the wilderness,
leaning on a staff.</p>

<p class='c018'>3. And Abraham arose, and met him, and said unto him, Turn in, I pray
thee, and warm thy feet, and tarry all night, and thou shalt arise early on
the morrow, and go on thy way.</p>

<p class='c018'>4. But the man said, Nay, for I will abide under this tree.</p>

<p class='c018'>5. And Abraham pressed him greatly; so he turned, and they went into
the tent; and Abraham baked unleavened bread, and they did eat.</p>

<p class='c018'>6. And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not God, he said unto
him, Wherefore dost thou not worship the most High God, Creator of Heaven
and Earth?</p>

<p class='c018'>7. And the man answered and said, I do not worship the God thou speakest
of, neither do I call upon his name; for I have made to myself a God,
which abideth always in mine house, and provideth me with all things.</p>

<p class='c018'>8. And Abraham’s zeal was kindled against the man, and he arose and
fell upon him, and drove him forth into the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>9. And at midnight God called unto Abraham, saying, Abraham, where
is the stranger?</p>

<p class='c018'>10. And Abraham answered and said, Lord, he would not worship Thee,
neither would he call upon Thy name; therefore have I driven him out
from before my face into the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c018'>11. And God said, Have I borne with him these hundred and ninety and
eight years, and nourished him and clothed him, notwithstanding his
rebellion against Me; and couldst not thou, that art thyself a sinner, bear
with him one night?</p>

<p class='c018'>12. And Abraham said, Let not the anger of my Lord wax hot against
His servant: Lo, I haved sinned; forgive me, I pray Thee.</p>

<p class='c018'>13. And he arose, and went forth into the wilderness, and sought
diligently for the man, and found him:</p>

<p class='c018'>14. And returned with him to his tent: and when he had entreated
him kindly, he sent him away on the morrow with gifts.</p>

<p class='c018'>15. And God spake again unto Abraham, saying, For this thy sin shall
thy seed be afflicted four hundred years in a strange land:</p>

<p class='c018'>16. But for thy repentance will I deliver them; and they shall come
forth with power, and with gladness of heart, and with much substance.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE SHAKSPEARE FORGERIES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In 1795–96 William Henry Ireland perpetrated the remarkable
Shakspeare Forgeries which gave his name such infamous
notoriety. The plays of “Vortigern” and “Henry the Second”
were printed in 1799. Several litterateurs of note were deceived
by them, and Sheridan produced the former at Drury Lane
theatre, with John Kemble to take the leading part. The total
failure of the play, conjoined with the attacks of Malone and
others, eventually led to a conviction and forced confession of
Ireland’s dishonesty. For an authentic account of the Shakspeare
Manuscripts see <cite>The Confessions of W. H. Ireland</cite>;
Chalmers’ <cite>Apology for the Believers of the Shakspeare Papers</cite>;
Malone’s <cite>Inquiry into the Authenticity</cite>, &amp;c.; Wilson’s <cite>Shaksperiana</cite>;
<cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>, 1796–97; <cite>Eclectic Magazine</cite>, xvi.
476. One of the original manuscripts of Ireland, that of Henry
the Second, has been preserved. The rascal seems to have
felt but little penitence for his fraud.</p>

  <h2 id='c277' class='c006'>Interrupted Sentences.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A Judge, reprimanding a criminal, called him a scoundrel.
The prisoner replied: “Sir, I am not as big a scoundrel as your
Honor”—here the culprit stopped, but finally added—“takes
me to be.” “Put your words closer together,” said the Judge.</p>

<p class='c000'>A lady in a dry goods store, while inspecting some cloths,
remarked that they were “part cotton.” “Madam,” said the
shopman, “these goods are as free from cotton as your breast
is”—(the lady frowned) he added—“free from guile.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A lady was reading aloud in a circle of friends a letter just
received. She read, “We are in great trouble. Poor Mary has
been confined”—and there she stopped for that was the last word
on the sheet, and the next sheet had dropped and fluttered away,
and poor Mary, unmarried, was left really in a delicate situation
until the missing sheet was found, and the next continued—“to
her room for three days, with what, we fear, is suppressed scarlet
fever.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To all letters soliciting his “subscription” to any object
Lord Erskine had a regular form of reply, viz.:—“Sir, I feel
much honored by your application to me, and beg to subscribe”—here
the reader had to turn over the leaf—“myself your very
obedient servant.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Much more satisfactory to the recipient was Lord Eldon’s
note to his friend, Dr. Fisher, of the Charter House:—“Dear
Fisher—I cannot to day give you the preferment for which you
ask. Your sincere friend, Eldon. (<i>Turn over</i>)—I gave it to
you yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Virginia Springs a Western girl name Helen was
familiarly known among her admirers as Little Hel. At a party
given in her native city, a gentleman, somewhat the worse for his
supper, approached a very dignified young lady and asked:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“Where’s my little sweetheart? You know,—Little Hel?”
“Sir?” exclaimed the lady, “you certainly forgot yourself.”
“Oh,” said he quickly, “you interrupted me; if you had let
me go on I would have said Little Helen.” “I beg your
pardon,” answered the lady, “when you said Little Hel, I
thought you had reached your final destination.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The value of an explanation is finely illustrated in the old
story of a king who sent to another king, saying, “Send me a
blue pig with a black tail, or else——.” The other, in high
dudgeon at the presumed insult, replied: “I have not got one,
and if I had——.” On this weighty cause they went to war
for many years. After a satiety of glories and miseries, they
finally bethought them that, as their armies and resources were
exhausted, and their kingdoms mutually laid waste, it might be
well enough to consult about the preliminaries of peace; but
before this could be concluded, a diplomatic explanation was
first needed of the insulting language which formed the ground
of the quarrel. “What could you mean,” said the second king
to the first, “by saying, ‘Send me a blue pig with a black tail,
or else——?’” “Why,” said the other, “I meant a blue pig
with a black tail, or else some other color. But,” retorted he,
“what did you mean by saying, ‘I have not got one, and if I
had——?’” “Why, of course, if I had, I should have sent
it.” An explanation which was entirely satisfactory, and peace
was concluded accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is related of Dr. Mansel, that when an undergraduate of
Trinity College, Cambridge, he chanced to call at the rooms of
a brother Cantab, who was absent, but who had left on his
table the opening of a poem, which was in the following lofty
strain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The sun’s perpendicular rays</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Illumine the depths of the sea,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Here the flight of the poet, by some accident, stopped short,
but Mansel, who never lost an occasion for fun, completed the
stanza in the following facetious style:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“And the fishes beginning to sweat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cried, ‘Goodness, how hot we shall be.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That not very brilliant joke, “to lie—under a mistake,” is
sometimes indulged in by the best writers. Witness the following.
Byron says:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Should captains the remark, or critics make,</div>
      <div class='line'>They also lie too—under a mistake.</div>

<p class='c000'>Shelley, in his translation of the <cite>Magico Prodigioso</cite> of Calderon,

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c000'>And De Quincey, <cite>Milton versus Southey and Landor</cite>,
says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>You are tempted, after walking round a line (of Milton)
threescore times, to exclaim at last,—Well, if the Fiend himself
should rise up before me at this very moment, in this very
study of mine, and say that no screw was loose in that line,
then would I reply: “Sir, with due submission, you are——.”
“What!” suppose the Fiend suddenly to demand in thunder.
“What am I?” “Horribly wrong,” you wish exceedingly to
say; but, recollecting that some people are choleric in argument,
you confine yourself to the polite answer—“That, with
deference to his better education, you conceive him to lie”—that’s
a bad word to drop your voice upon in talking with a
friend, and you hasten to add—“under a slight, a <i>very</i> slight
mistake.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Mr. Montague Mathew, who sometimes amused the House of
Commons, and alarmed the Ministers, with his <i>brusquerie</i>, set
an ingenious example to those who are at once forbidden to
speak, and yet resolved to express their thoughts. There was
a debate upon the treatment of Ireland, and Mathew having
been called to order for taking unseasonable notice of the enormities
attributed to the British Government, spoke to the following
effect:—“Oh, very well; I shall say nothing then about the
murders—(<i>Order, order!</i>)—I shall make no mention of the
massacres—(<i>Hear, hear! Order!</i>)—Oh, well; I shall sink all
allusion to the infamous half-hangings—”(<i>Order, order! Chair!</i>)</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Chatham once began a speech on West Indian affairs,
in the House of Commons, with the words: “Sugar, Mr.
Speaker——” and then, observing a smile to prevail in the
audience, he paused, looked fiercely around, and with a loud
voice, rising in its notes, and swelling into vehement anger, he
is said to have pronounced again the word “Sugar!” three times;
and having thus quelled the House, and extinguished every
appearance of levity or laughter, turned around, and disdainfully
asked, “Who will laugh at sugar now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Our legislative assemblies, under the most exciting circumstances,
convey no notion of the phrenzied rage which sometimes
agitates the French. Mirabeau interrupted once at every
sentence by an insult, with “slanderer,” “liar,” “assassin,”
“rascal,” rattling around him, addressed the most furious of his
assailants in the softest tone he could assume, saying, “I pause,
gentlemen, till these civilities are exhausted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Marten, M. P., was a great wit. One evening he delivered
a furious philippic against Sir Harry Vane, and when he
had buried him beneath a load of sarcasm, he said:—“But as
for young Sir Harry Vane——” and so sat down. The House
was astounded. Several members exclaimed: “What have you
to say against young Sir Harry?” Marten at once rose and added:
“Why, if young Sir Harry lives to be old, <i>he</i> will be old
Sir Harry.”</p>

  <h2 id='c281' class='c006'>Echo Verse.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Addison says, in No. 59 of the Spectator, “I find likewise
in ancient times the conceit of making an Echo talk sensibly
and give rational answers. If this could be excusable in any
writer, it would be in Ovid, where he introduces the echo as a
nymph, before she was worn away into nothing but a voice.
(Met. iii. 379.) The learned Erasmus, though a man of wit
and genius, has composed a dialogue upon this silly kind of
device, and made use of an echo who seems to have been an
extraordinary linguist, for she answers the person she talks
with in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, according as she found the
syllables which she was to repeat in any of those learned languages.
Hudibras, in ridicule of this false kind of wit, has
described Bruin bewailing the loss of his bear to a solitary
echo, who is of great use to the poet in several distichs, as she
does not only repeat after him, but helps out his verse and
furnishes him with rhymes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Euripides in his Andromeda—a tragedy now lost—had a
similar scene, which Aristophanes makes sport with in his Feast
of Ceres. In the Greek Anthology (iii. 6) is an epigram of
Leonidas, and in Book IV. are some lines by Guaradas, commencing—</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>REMARKABLE ECHOES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>An echo in Woodstock Park, Oxfordshire, repeats seventeen
syllables by day, and twenty by night. One on the banks of
the Lago del Lupo, above the fall of Terni, repeats fifteen.
But the most remarkable echo known is one on the north side
of Shipley Church, in Sussex, which distinctly repeats twenty-one
syllables.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Abbey church at St. Alban’s is a curious echo. The
tick of a watch may be heard from one end of the church to
the other. In Gloucester Cathedral, a gallery of an octagonal
form conveys a whisper seventy-five feet across the nave.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following inscription is copied from this gallery:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Doubt not but God, who sits on high,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy inmost secret prayers can hear;</div>
      <div class='line'>When a dead wall thus cunningly</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Conveys soft whispers to the ear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the Cathedral of Girgenti, in Sicily, the slightest whisper
is borne with perfect distinctness from the great western door to
the cornice behind the high altar,—a distance of two hundred
and fifty feet. By a most unlucky coincidence, the precise
focus of divergence at the former station was chosen for the
place of the confessional. Secrets never intended for the public
ear thus became known, to the dismay of the confessors,
and the scandal of the people, by the resort of the curious to
the opposite point, (which seems to have been discovered accidentally,)
till at length, one listener having had his curiosity
somewhat over-gratified by hearing his wife’s avowal of her
own infidelity, this tell-tale peculiarity became generally known,
and the confessional was removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the whispering-gallery of St. Paul’s, London, the faintest
sound is faithfully conveyed from one side to the other of the
dome, but is not heard at any intermediate point.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Manfroni Palace at Venice is a square room about
twenty-five feet high, with a concave roof, in which a person
standing in the centre, and stamping gently with his foot on the
floor, hears the sound repeated a great many times; but as his
position deviates from the centre, the reflected sounds grow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>fainter, and at a short distance wholly cease. The same phenomenon
occurs in the large room of the Library of the
Museum at Naples.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EXTRAORDINARY FACTS IN ACOUSTICS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>An intelligent and very respectable gentleman, named Ebenezer
Snell, who is still living, at the age of eighty and upwards,
was in a corn-field with a negro on the 17th of June, 1776, in
the township of Cummington, Mass., one hundred and twenty-nine
miles west of Bunker Hill by the course of the road, and
at least one hundred by an air-line. Some time during the
day, the negro was lying on the ground, and remarked to
Ebenezer that there was war somewhere, for he could distinctly
hear the cannonading. Ebenezer put his ear to the ground,
and also heard the firing distinctly, and for a considerable time.
He remembers the fact, which made a deep impression on his
mind, as plainly as though it was yesterday.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over water, or a surface of ice, sound is propagated with remarkable
clearness and strength. Dr. Hutton relates that, on
a quiet part of the Thames near Chelsea, he could hear a person
read distinctly at the distance of one hundred and forty feet,
while on the land the same could only be heard at seventy-six.
Lieut. Foster, in the third Polar expedition of Capt. Parry, found
that he could hold conversation with a man across the harbor of
Port Bowen, a distance of six thousand six hundred and ninety-six
feet, or about a mile and a quarter. This, however, falls short
of what is asserted by Derham and Dr. Young,—viz., that at
Gibraltar the human voice has been heard at the distance of
ten miles, the distance across the strait.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Hearn, a Swedish physician, relates that he heard guns
fired at Stockholm, on the occasion of the death of one of the
royal family, in 1685, at the distance of thirty Swedish or one
hundred and eighty British miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cannonade of a sea-fight between the English and
Dutch, in 1672, was heard across England as far as Shrewsbury,
and even in Wales, a distance of upwards of two hundred
miles from the scene of action.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='c290' class='c006'>Puzzles.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The fastidiousness of mere book-learning, or the overweening
importance of politicians and men of business, may be employed
to cast contempt, or even odium, on the labor which is
spent in the solution of puzzles which produce no useful knowledge
when disclosed; but that which agreeably amuses both
young and old should, if not entitled to regard, be at least
exempt from censure. Nor have the greatest wits of this and
other countries disdained to show their skill in these trifles.
Homer, it is said, died of chagrin at not being able to expound a
riddle propounded by a simple fisherman,—“<i>Leaving what’s
taken, what we took not we bring</i>.” Aristotle was amazingly
perplexed, and Philetas, the celebrated grammarian and poet of
Cos, puzzled himself to death in fruitless endeavors to solve the
sophism called by the ancients <cite>The Liar</cite>:—“If you say of yourself,
‘I lie,’ and in so saying tell the truth, you lie. If you
say, ‘I lie,’ and in so saying tell a lie, you tell the truth.”
Dean Swift, who could so agreeably descend to the slightest
badinage, was very fond of puzzles. Many of the best riddles
in circulation may be traced to the sportive moments of men
of the greatest celebrity, who gladly seek occasional relaxation
from the graver pursuits of life, in comparative trifles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Barbauld says, Finding out riddles is the same kind of
exercise for the mind as running, leaping, and wrestling are for
the body. They are of no use in themselves; they are not
work, but play; but they prepare the body, and make it alert
and active for any thing it may be called upon to perform. So
does the finding out good riddles give quickness of thought,
and facility for turning about a problem every way, and viewing
it in every possible light.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French have excelled all other people in this species of
literary amusement. Their language is favorable to it, and
their writers have always indulged a fondness for it. As a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>specimen of the ingenuity of the earlier literati, we transcribe
a rebus of Jean Marot, a favorite old priest, and valet-de-chambre
to Francis I. It would be inexplicable to most readers
without the version in common French, which is subjoined:—</p>

first column of the cypher in capitals; then look for the letter <i>f</i>,
which is the first letter of the proclamation, and that letter
which corresponds with <i>f</i> being placed underneath, viz., <i>n</i>, is
that which is to be noted down. To decipher the proclamation,
of course the order of reference must be inverted, by
looking for the corresponding letter to <i>n</i> in the division opposite
that letter L which stands in the column.</p>

<p class='c013'>X. Y. applies to A. B. to become a law pupil, offering to pay
him the customary fee as soon as he shall have gained his <i>first
suit in law</i>. To this A. B. formally agrees, and admits X. Y.
to the privileges of a student. Before the termination of X.
Y.’s pupilage, however, A. B. gets tired of waiting for his
money, and determines to sue X. Y. for the amount. He reasons
thus:—If I gain this case, X. Y. will be compelled to pay
me by the decision of the court; if I lose it, he will have to
pay me by the condition of our contract, he having won his
first lawsuit. But X. Y. need not be alarmed when he learns
A. B.’s intention, for he may reason similarly. He may say,—If
I succeed, and the award of the court is in my favor, of
course I shall not have to pay the money; if the court decides
against me, I shall not have to pay it, according to the terms of
our contract, as I shall not yet have gained my first suit in law.

<h3 class='c012'>QUINCY’S COMPARISON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Josiah Quincy, in the course of a speech in Congress, in
1806, on the embargo, used the following language:—</p>

<p class='c000'>They who introduced it abjured it. They who advocated it
did not wish, and scarcely knew, its use. And now that it is
said to be extended over us, no man in this nation, who values
his reputation, will take his Bible oath that it is in effectual
and legal operation. There is an old riddle on a coffin, which
I presume we all learned when we were boys, that is as perfect
a representation of the origin, progress, and present state of
this thing called non-intercourse, as it is possible to be conceived:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There was a man bespoke a thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which when the maker home did bring,</div>
      <div class='line'>That same maker did refuse it,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The man that spoke for it did not use it,—</div>
      <div class='line'>And he who had it did not know</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether he had it, yea or no.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>True it is, that if this non-intercourse shall ever be, in
reality, subtended over us, the similitude will fail in a material
point. The poor tenant of the coffin is ignorant of his state.
But the people of the United States will be literally buried
alive in non-intercourse, and realize the grave closing on themselves
and on their hopes, with a full and cruel consciousness
of all the horrors of their condition.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>SINGULAR INTERMARRIAGES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There were married at Durham, Canada East, an old lady and
gentleman, involving the following interesting connections:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The old gentleman is married to his daughter’s husband’s
mother-in-law, and his daughter’s husband’s wife’s mother.
And yet she is not his daughter’s mother; but she is his grandchildren’s
grandmother, and his wife’s grandchildren are his
daughter’s step-children. Consequently the old lady is united
in the bonds of holy matrimony and conjugal affection to her
daughter’s brother-in-law’s father-in-law, and her great-grandchildren’s
grandmother’s step-father; so that her son-in-law
may say to his children, Your grandmother is married to my
father-in-law, and yet he is not your grandfather; but he is
your grandmother’s son-in-law’s wife’s father. This gentleman
married his son-in-law’s father-in-law’s wife, and he is
bound to support and protect her for life. His wife is his
son-in-law’s children’s grandmother, and his son-in-law’s grandchildren’s
great-grandmother.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Mr. Harwood had two daughters by his first wife, the
eldest of whom was married to John Coshick; this Coshick
had a daughter by his first wife, whom old Harwood married,
and by her he had a son; therefore, John Coshick’s second
wife could say as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the curious things extant in relation to Luther is the
covert attempt of an ingenious theological opponent to make
him the apocalyptic beast or antichrist described in Revelation
ch. xiii. The mysterious number of the beast, “six hundred
threescore and six,” excited the curiosity of mankind at a very
early period, particularly that of Irenæus, in the second century,
who indulged in a variety of shrewd conjectures on the
subject. But after discovering the number in several names,
he modestly says, “Yet I venture not to pronounce positively
concerning the name of antichrist, for, had it been intended to
be openly proclaimed to the present generation, it would have
been uttered by the same person who saw the revelation.” A
later expositor, Fevardent, in his Notes on Irenæus, adds to
the list the name of Martin Luther, which, he says, was originally
written Martin Lauter. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Initio vocabatur <i>Martin Lauter</i></span>,”
says Fevardent; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cujus nominis literas si Pythagorice et ratione

<h3 class='c012'>THE BOOK OF RIDDLES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Book of Riddles alluded to by Shakspeare in the Merry
Wives of Windsor (Act I. sc. I) is mentioned by Laneham,
1575, and in the English Courtier, 1586; but the earliest edition
of this popular collection now preserved is dated 1629. It
is entitled The <cite>Booke of Merry Riddles, together with proper
Questions and witty Proverbs to make pleasant pastime; no
less usefull then behovefull for any young man or child, to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>if he be quick-witted or no</cite>. The following extract from this
very rare work will be found interesting.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>Here beginneth the first Riddle.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>Two legs sat upon three legs, and had one leg in her hand;
then in came foure legs, and bare away one leg; then up start
two legs, and threw three legs at foure legs, and brought again
one leg.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Solution.</i>—That is, a woman with two legs sate on a stoole
with three legs, and had a leg of mutton in her hand; then
came a dog that hath foure legs, and bare away the leg of mutton;
then up start the woman, and threw the stoole with three
legs at the dog with foure legs, and brought again the leg of
mutton.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>The Second Riddle.</i></h4>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He went to the wood and caught it,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sate him down and sought it;</div>
      <div class='line'>Because he could not finde it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Home with him he brought it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><i>Solution.</i>—That is a thorne: for a man went to the wood
and caught a thorne in his foote, and then he sate him downe,
and sought to have it pulled out, and because he could not find
it out, he must needs bring it home.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>The</i> iii. <i>Riddle.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>What work is that, the faster ye worke, the longer it is ere ye
have done, and the slower ye worke, the sooner ye make an end?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Solution.</i>—That is turning of a spit; for if ye turne fast, it
will be long ere the meat be rosted, but if ye turne slowly, the
sooner it is rosted.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><i>The</i> iv. <i>Riddle.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>What is that that shineth bright all day, and at night is
raked up in its own dirt?</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CURIOSITIES OF CIPHER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In 1680, when M. de Louvois was French Minister of War,
he summoned before him one day, a gentleman named Chamilly,
and gave him the following instructions:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Start this evening for Basle, in Switzerland, which you will
reach in three days; on the fourth, punctually at two o’clock,
station yourself on the bridge over the Rhine, with a portfolio,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>ink, and a pen. Watch all that takes place, and make a memorandum
of every particular. Continue doing so for two hours; have
a carriage and post-horses await you; and at four precisely,
mount and travel night and day till you reach Paris. On the
instant of your arrival, hasten to me with your notes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>De Chamilly obeyed; he reaches Basle, and on the day, and
at the hour appointed, stations himself, pen in hand, on the
bridge. Presently a market-cart drives by, then an old woman
with a basket of fruit passes; anon, a little urchin trundles
his hoop by; next an old gentlemen in blue top-coat jogs past
on his gray mare. Three o’clock chimes from the cathedral-tower.
Just at the last stroke, a tall fellow in yellow waistcoat
and breeches saunters up, goes to the middle of the bridge,
lounges over, and looks at the water; then he takes a step back
and strikes three hearty blows on the footway with his staff.
Down goes every detail in De Chamilly’s book. At last the
hour of release sounds, and he jumps into his carriage. Shortly
before midnight, after two days of ceaseless traveling, De
Chamilly presented himself before the Minister, feeling rather
ashamed at having such trifles to record. M. de Louvois took
the portfolio with eagerness, and glanced over the notes. As
his eye caught the mention of the yellow-breeched man, a gleam
of joy flashed across his countenance. He rushed to the king,
roused him from sleep, spoke in private with him for a few
moments, and then four couriers, who had been held in readiness
since five on the preceding evening, were dispatched with haste.
Eight days after the town of Strasbourg was entirely surrounded
by French troops, and summoned to surrender; it capitulated
and threw open its gates on the 30th September, 1681. Evidently
the three strokes of the stick given by the fellow in
yellow costume, at an appointed hour, were the signal of the
success of an intrigue concerted between M. de Louvois and
the magistrates of Strasbourg, and the man who executed this
mission was as ignorant of the motive as was M. de Chamilly
of the motive of his errand.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Now this is a specimen of the safest of all secret communications;
but it can only be resorted to on certain rare occasions.
When a lengthy dispatch is required to be forwarded, and when
such means as those given above are out of the question, some
other method must be employed. Herodotus gives us a story
to the point; it is found also, with variations, in Aulus
Gellius:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Histiæus, when he was anxious to give Aristagoras orders
to revolt, could find but one safe way, as the roads were guarded,
of making his wishes known; which was by taking the trustiest
of his slaves, shaving all the hair from off his head, and then
pricking letters upon the skin, and waiting till the hair grew
again. This accordingly he did; and as soon as ever the hair
was grown, he dispatched the man to Miletus, giving him no
other message than this: ‘When thou art come to Miletus, bid
Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon.’ Now the marks
on the head were a command to revolt.”—(Bk. V. 35.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Is this case no cipher was employed. We shall come now to
the use of ciphers.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a dispatch or communication runs great risk of falling
into the hands of the enemy, it is necessary that its contents
should be so veiled that the possession of the document may
afford him no information whatever. Julius Cæsar and Augustus
used ciphers, but they were of the utmost simplicity, as they
consisted merely in placing D in the place of A; E in that of
B and so on; or else in writing B for A, and C for B, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secret characters were used at the Council of Nicæa; and
Rabanus Maurus, Abbot of Fulda and Archbishop of Mayence,
in the Ninth Century, has left us an example of two ciphers, the
key to which was discovered by the Benedictines. It is only a
wonder that any one could have failed to unravel them at the
first glance. This is a specimen of the first:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c015'>
    <div>.Nc.p.tv:rs:.:sB::nf:c..:rch.gl::r::s.q:.::m:</div>
    <div>rt.r.s</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>The clue to this is the suppression of the vowels and the
filling of their places by dots—one for i, two for a, three for e,
four for o, and five for u. In the second example, the same
sentence would run—Knckpkt vfrsxs Bpnkfbckk, &amp;c., the vowel
places being filled by the consonants—b, f, k, p, x. By changing
every letter in the alphabet, we make a vast improvement
on this last; thus, for instance, supplying the place of a with z,
b with x, c with v, and so on. This is the very system employed
by an advertiser in a provincial paper, which we took up the
other day in the waiting-room of a station, where it had been
left by a farmer. As we had some minutes to spare, before the
train was due, we spent them in deciphering the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Jp Sjddjzbrza rzdd ci sijmr. Bziw rzdd xrndzt, and in ten
minutes we read: “If William can call or write, Mary will be
glad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Chevalier de Rohan was in the Bastile his friends
wanted to convey to him the intelligence that his accomplice
was dead without having confessed. They did so by passing
the following words into his dungeon written on a shirt: “Mg
dulhxecclgu ghj yxuj; lm et ulge alj.” In vain did he puzzle
over the cipher, to which he had not the clue. It was too
short; for the shorter a cipher letter, the more difficult it is to
make out. The light faded, and he tossed on his hard bed,
sleeplessly revolving the mystic letters in his brain; but he
could make nothing out of them. Day dawned, and with its
first gleam he was poring over them; still in vain. He pleaded
guilty, for he could not decipher “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Le prisonnier est mort; il
n’a rien dit</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious instance of cipher occurred at the close of the
sixteenth century, when the Spaniards were endeavoring to
establish relations between the scattered branches of their vast
monarchy, which at that period embraced a large portion of
Italy, the Low Countries, the Philippines, and enormous districts
in the New World. They accordingly invented a cipher, which
they varied from time to time, in order to disconcert those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>might attempt to pry into the mysteries of their correspondence.
The cipher, composed of fifty signs, was of great value to them
through all the troubles of the “Ligue,” and the wars then
desolating Europe. Some of their dispatches having been intercepted,
Henry IV. handed them over to a clever mathematician,
Viete, with the request that he would find the clue.
He did so, and was able also to follow it as it varied, and
France profited for two years by his discovery. The Court of
Spain, disconcerted at this, accused Viete before the Roman
Court as a sorcerer and in league with the devil. This proceeding
only gave rise to laughter and ridicule.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>A still more remarkable instance is that of a German professor,
Herman, who boasted, in 1752, that he had discovered a
cryptograph absolutely incapable of being deciphered without
the clue being given by him; and he defied all the savants and
learned societies of Europe to discover the key. However, a
French refugee, named Beguelin, managed after eight days’
study to read it. The cipher—though we have the rules upon
which it is formed before us—is to us perfectly unintelligible.
It is grounded on some changes of numbers and symbols;
the numbers vary, being at one time multiplied, at another
added, and become so complicated that the letter <i>e</i>, which
occurs nine times in the paragraph, is represented in eight
different ways; <i>n</i> is used eight times, and has seven various
signs. Indeed, the same letter is scarcely ever represented
by the same figure. But this is not all; the character which
appears in the place of <i>i</i> takes that of <i>n</i> shortly after; another
Symbol for <i>n</i> stands also for <i>t</i>. How any man could have
solved the mystery of this cipher is astonishing.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these cryptographs consist in the exchange of numbers
of characters for the real letters; but there are other methods
quite as intricate, which dispense with them.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>The mysterious cards of the Count de Vergennes are an
instance. De Vergennes was Minister of Foreign Affairs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>under Louis XVI., and he made use of cards of a peculiar
nature in his relations with the diplomatic agents of France.
These cards were used in letters of recommendation or passports,
which were given to strangers about to enter France;
they were intended to furnish information without the
knowledge of the bearers. This was the system. The card
given to a man contained only a few words, such as:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c015'>
    <div><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ALPHONSE D’ANGEHA,</span></div>
    <div><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recommande a Monsieur</span></div>
    <div><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Comte de Vergennes, par le Marquis de Puysegur, Ambassadeur</span></div>
    <div><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de France a la Cour de Lisbonne.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The card told more tales than the words written on it. Its
color indicated the nation of the stranger. Yellow showed
him to be English; red, Spanish; white, Portuguese; green,
Dutch; red and white, Italian; red and green, Swiss; green
and white, Russian; &amp;c. The person’s age was expressed by
the shape of the card. If it were circular, he was under
25; oval, between 25 and 30; octagonal, between 30 and 45;
hexagonal, between 45 and 50; square, between 50 and 60;
an oblong showed that he was over 60. Two lines placed
below the name of the bearer indicated his build. If he were
tall and lean, the lines were waving and parallel; tall and stout,
they converged; and so on. The expression of his face was
shown by a flower in the border. A rose designated an open
and amiable countenance, whilst a tulip marked a pensive and
aristocratic appearance. A fillet round the border, according
to its length, told whether he were bachelor, married, or
widower. Dots gave information as to his position and fortune.
A full stop after his name showed that he was a Catholic; a
semicolon, that he was a Lutheran; a comma, that he was a
Calvinist; a dash, that he was a Jew; no stop indicated him an
Atheist. So also his morals and character were pointed out by
a pattern in the card. So, at one glance the Minister could
tell all about his man, whether he were a gamester or a duelist;
what was his purpose in visiting France; whether in search
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>of a wife or to claim a legacy; what was his profession—that
of physician, lawyer, or man of letters; whether he
were to be put under surveillance or allowed to go his way
unmolested.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>We come now to a class of cipher which requires a certain
amount of literary dexterity to conceal the clue.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the Great Rebellion, Sir John Trevanion, a distinguished
cavalier, was made prisoner, and locked up in
Colchester Castle. Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle had
just been made examples of, as a warning to “malignants:”
and Trevanion had every reason for expecting a similar bloody
end. As he awaits his doom, indulging in a hearty curse
in round cavalier terms at the canting, crop-eared scoundrels
who hold him in durance vile, and muttering a wish that he
had fallen, sword in hand, facing the foe, he is startled by the
entrance of the jailor, who hands him a letter:</p>

<p class='c000'>“May’t do thee good,” growls the fellow; “it has been well
looked to before it was permitted to come to thee.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir John takes the letter, and the jailor leaves him his lamp
by which to read it:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Worthie Sir John</span>:—Hope, that is ye best comport of ye afflictyd,
cannot much, I fear me, help you now. That I wolde saye to you, is this
only: if ever I may be able to requite that I do owe you, stand not upon
asking of me. ’Tis not much I can do; but what I can do, bee verie sure
I wille. I knowe that, if dethe comes, if ordinary men fear it, it frights
not you, accounting it for a high honour, to have such a rewarde of your
loyalty. Pray yet that you may be spared this soe bitter, cup. I fear
not that you will grudge any sufferings; only if it bie submission you
can turn them away, ’tis the part of a wise man. Tell me, an if you can,
to do for you any thinge that you would have done. The general goes
back on Wednesday. Restinge your servant to command.</p>

<div class='c039'>R. T.</div>

<p class='c000'>Now this letter was written according to a preconcerted
cipher. Every third letter after a stop was to tell. In this
way Sir John made out—“Panel at east end of chapel slides.”
On the following even, the prisoner begged to be allowed to
pass an hour of private devotion in the chapel. By means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>a bribe, this was accomplished. Before the hour had expired,
the chapel was empty—the bird had flown.</p>

<p class='c000'>An excellent plan of indicating the telling letter or words is
through the heading of the letter. “Sir,” would signify that
every third letter was to be taken; “Dear Sir,” that every
seventh; “My dear sir,” that every ninth was to be selected.
A system, very early adopted, was that of having pierced cards,
through the holes of which the communication was written.
The card was then removed, and the blank spaces filled up. As
for example:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>My dear X.</span>—[The] lines I now send you are forwarded by the kindness
of the [Bearer], who is a friend. [Is not] the message delivered yet
[to] my brother? [Be] quick about it, for I have all along [trusted] that
you would act with discretion and dispatch.</p>

<div class='c039'>Yours ever, &#8196; &#8196; &#8196; Z.</div>

<p class='c000'>Put your card over the note, and through the piercings you
will read: “The Bearer is not to be trusted.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Poe, in his story of “The Gold Bug,” gives some valuable
hints on the interpretation of the most common cryptographs.
He contends that the ingenuity of man can construct no enigma
which the ingenuity of man cannot unravel. And he actually
read several very difficult ciphers which were sent to him after
the publication of “The Gold Bug.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But we saw, several years ago, a method which makes the
message absolutely safe from detection. We will try to describe
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Take a square sheet of paper of convenient size, say a foot
square. Divide it by lines drawn at right angles into five
hundred and seventy-six squares, twenty-six each way; in the
upper horizontal row write the alphabet in its natural order, one
letter in each square; in the second horizontal row write the
alphabet, beginning with B. There will then be one square
left at the end of this row; into this put A. Fill the third row
by beginning with C, and writing A and B after Z at the end.
So on until the whole sheet is filled. When completed, the
table, if correct, will present this appearance. In the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>horizontal row, the alphabet in its natural order from left to
right; in the left-hand vertical row, the same from top to bottom;
and the diagonal, from upper right to lower left-hand corner,
will be a line of Z’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each party must have one of the tables. A key-word must be
agreed upon, which may be any word in the English language,
or from any other language if it can be represented by English
letters, or, indeed, it may even be a combination of letters
which spells nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, to send a message, first write the message in plain
English. Over it write the key-word, letter over letter, repeating
it as many times as it is necessary to cover the message. Take
a simple case as an illustration. Suppose the key-word to be
<i>Grant</i>, and the message <i>We have five days’ provisions</i>. It
should be placed thus:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c015'>
    <div>Grantgrantgrantgrantgran</div>
    <div>Wehavefivedaysprovisions</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Now find, in the upper horizontal row of the table, the first
letter of the key-word, G, and in the left-hand vertical column,
the first letter of the message, W. Run a line straight down
from G, and one to the right from W, and in the angle where
the two lines meet will be found the letter which must be
written as the first letter of the cipher. With the second letter
of the key-word, R, and the second letter of the message, E,
find in the same way the second letter of the cipher.</p>

<p class='c000'>The correspondent who receives the cipher goes to work to
translate it thus:—He first writes over it the key-word, letter
over letter, repeating it as often as necessary. Then finding in
the upper row of his table the first letter of the key-word, he
passes his pencil directly down until he comes to the first letter
or the cipher; the letter opposite to it in the left vertical column
is the first letter of the translation. Each of the succeeding
letters is found in a similar way.</p>

<p class='c000'>A third party, into whose hands such a cipher might fall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>could not read it, though he possessed a copy of the table and
knew how to use it, unless he knew the key-word. The chance
of his guessing this is only one in millions. And there is no
such thing as interpreting it by any other method, because there
are no repetitions, and hence all comparison is at fault. That is
to say, in the same cipher, in one place a letter, as for instance
C may stand for one letter in the translation, and in another
place C may stand for quite a different letter. This is the only
kind of cryptograph we have ever seen which is absolutely safe.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WHY THE GERMANS EAT SAUER-KRAUT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The reason why the most learned people on earth eat sauer-kraut

ligne 30: “Finally, in order to omit nothing which can add to
the knowledge of simples, it must be noted that Nature, mother
and producer of all things, has created various simples, which
have a sympathy or natural antipathy to each other; which is
a very considerable point in this matter, and has no like as a
mystery and secret. And thus it has seemed to me good to
hint a word about it, and principally of those which are used in
medicine. To commence, then, with the oak and the olive;
these two trees hate each other in such sort that, if you plant
one in the hole from which the other was dug, it will die there;
and, even if you plant one near the other, they will work each
other’s death. The cabbage and the vine do the like; for it
has been seen that, if you plant a cabbage at the foot of a vine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the vine will recoil and draw itself away. And thus it is no
marvel that the cabbage is very useful to sober topers, and that
the Germans eat it commonly in <i>a compost</i> to safeguard themselves
from their wine.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BOSTON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the seventh century a Roman Catholic monk by the name
of Botolph, or Bot-holp, viz., Boat-help, founded a church in
what is now Lincolnshire, England. Gradually a town grew
up around the church, and was called Botolphstown, which was
afterward contracted into Botolphston, and then shortened to
Botoston, and finally to Boston. From that town of Boston in
Lincolnshire came to America the Rev. John Cotton, who gave
the name to the New England Capital. So that the metropolis
of good old Puritan Massachusetts was, it seems, named in
honor of a Roman Catholic saint and monk!</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>WEATHERCOCKS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The vane or weathercock must have been of very early origin.
Vitruvius calls it <i>triton</i>, evidently from an ancient form. The
usual form on towers and castles was that of a banner; but on
ecclesiastical edifices, it generally was a <i>weathercock</i>. There
was a symbolical reason for the adoption of the figure of a cock.
The cross was surmounted by a ball, to symbolize the redemption
of the world by the cross of Christ; and the cock was
placed upon the cross in allusion to the repentance of St. Peter,
and to remind us of the important duties of repentance and
Christian vigilance. Apart from symbolism, the large tail of
the cock is well adapted to turn with the wind, just as is the arrow
which is so frequently chosen.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CUTTING OFF WITH A SHILLING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>According to Blackstone (ii. 32), the Romans were wont to
set aside testaments as being <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inofficiosa</span></i>, deficient in natural duty,
if they disinherited or totally passed by (without assigning a
true and sufficient reason) any of the children of the testator.
But if the child had any legacy, though ever so small, it was a
proof that the testator had not lost his memory or his reason,
which otherwise the law presumed; but was then supposed to
have acted thus for some substantial cause, and in such case no
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">querula inofficiosi testamenti</span></i> was allowed. Hence, probably, has
arisen that groundless error of the necessity of leaving the heir
a shilling, or some such express legacy, in order to disinherit
him effectually. Whereas the law of England makes no such
constrained suppositions of forgetfulness or insanity; and, therefore,
though the heir or next of kin be totally omitted, it admits
no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">querula inofficiosi</span></i> to set aside such a testament.</p>

<p class='c013'>The red hat was given to cardinals by Pope Innocent IV., in

of the church.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A JUGGLER’S MYSTERY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The French Government, which formerly sent dancing-girls
and comic actors to cheer up its soldiers when they were
ordered away from the dancing-saloons and theatres, so common
throughout France, engaged Mr. Robert Houdin to go to
Algeria and exhibit his best feats of legerdemain before the
natives, to shake the excessive influence exerted by the marabouts
or priests, whose power seems to be established solely on
their adroit jugglery. The marabouts were not disposed to
yield to the new-comer’s powers without a struggle, and pressed
him as hard as they could. M. Houdin was successful, but his
victory was not altogether easy, as he tells in the following
narrative:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The marabout said to me: “I believe now in your supernatural
power. You are really a sorcerer. I hope, therefore,
you will not refuse to repeat here an exhibition of your powers
made on your stage.” He gave me two pistols, which he had
concealed under his bournous, and said: “Choose one of those
pistols; we are going to load it, and I shall fire it at you. You
have nothing to fear, since you know how to parry any bullet.”
I confess I was for a moment dumb with embarrassment. I
tried my best to think of some subterfuge, but I could think
of nothing. Every eye was fixed on me, in expectation of my
reply. The marabout was triumphant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bou Allem, who knew that my tricks were due solely to my
adroitness, became angry that his guests should be annoyed in
this barbarous way, and he scolded the marabout. I stopped
him. An idea had struck me which would at least extricate
me for the moment from my embarrassment. So I said to the
marabout, speaking with all the assurance I could summon:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“You know that I am not invulnerable unless I have a talisman
on me. Unfortunately, I have left it at Algiers.” The marabout
began to laugh incredulously. “Nevertheless,” I went on
to say, “if I remain in prayer for six hours, I shall be able to
make myself invulnerable to your pistol, even though I have
no talisman. To-morrow morning, at eleven o’clock, I shall let
you fire at me before all these Arabs, who are witnesses of your
challenge.” Bou Allem, astonished to hear me make such
a promise, came up and asked me in a low tone if I was
speaking seriously, and if he should invite the Arabs to come
the next day. I told him I was. I need not say I did not
spend the night in prayers, but I worked for two hours to make
myself invulnerable, and then satisfied with my success, I went
to sleep with a great deal of pleasure, for I was horribly tired.
We breakfasted before eight o’clock, the next morning; our
horses were saddled, and our escort was waiting the signal of
departure, which was to take place immediately after the famous
experiment. The same persons who were present at the challenge
the day before, were at the rendezvous, and a great many
other Arabs who had heard of what was to take place, had come
to witness it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pistols were brought. I made them observe the touch-hole
was clear. The marabout put a good load of powder in
the pistol and rammed it down well. I chose a ball from among
the balls brought, I ostensibly put it in the pistol and rammed
it thoroughly. The marabout kept a good eye on me: his honor
was at stake. The second pistol was loaded as the first had
been, and now came the trying moment. Trying indeed it was
for everybody. For the Arabs around, uncertain how the experiment
would end; for my wife, who had in vain begged me
not to try the experiment which she was afraid of—and I
confess it, trying for me, as my new trick was based on none of
the expedients I had hitherto used, and I was afraid of some
mistake, some treachery, some accident. Nevertheless, I stood
fifteen paces in front of the marabout, without exhibiting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>least emotion. The marabout instantly took up one of the
pistols, and at the given signal he aimed deliberately at me.
He fired. I caught the ball in my teeth. More irritated than
ever, the marabout ran to snatch up the other pistol; I was
quickest and I seized it. “You failed to draw blood from me,”
said I to him; “now look, I am going to draw blood from that
wall yonder.” I fired at a wall which had just been whitewashed;
instantly a large clot of blood was seen on it. The
marabout went up to it, put a finger on it, tasted it, and satisfied
himself it was really blood. His arms fell down at his side, he
hung his head, he was overcome. It was evident he doubted
now of everything, even of the Prophet. The Arabs raised their
hands to Heaven, muttered prayers, and looked at me with
dread.</p>

<p class='c000'>This trick, however curious it may seem, is managed easily
enough. I shall describe it. As soon as I was alone in my
chamber, I took out of my pistol-case (which I carry with me
wherever I go) a ball-mould. I took a card, turned up its
corners and made a sort of recipient of it, in which I placed
a lump of stearine, taken from one of the candles in the room.
As soon as the stearine was melted, I mixed a little lamp-black
with it—which I obtained by holding a knife over a lighted
candle—and then I poured this composition into my ball-mould.
If I had allowed the liquid stearine to become entirely cold,
the ball would have been solid; but after ten or twelve seconds
I reversed the mould, and the portion of the stearine which was
not yet solid flowed out and left a hollow ball in the mould.
This, by the way, is the mode in which the hollow candles used
in the churches are made; the thickness of the sides depends
on the time the melted stearine or wax is left in the mould. I
wanted a second ball. I made it a little thicker than the first.
I filled it with blood, and I closed the aperture with a drop of
stearine. An Irishman had showed me years before, how to
extract blood from the thumb without pain: I adopted his trick
to fill my ball with blood. It is hard to believe how nearly these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>projectiles of stearine, colored with lamp-black, look like lead:
they will deceive anybody, even when examined quite closely.
The reader now clearly sees through the trick. While exhibiting
the lead bullet to the spectators, I changed it for my hollow ball,
and this last I ostensibly placed in the pistol. I rammed it
down, to break the stearine into small pieces, which could not
reach me at fifteen paces. As soon as the pistol was discharged,
I opened my mouth and exhibited the lead ball between my
teeth. The second pistol contained the ball filled with blood,
which was broken to pieces on the wall, where it left the spot
of blood, while the pieces of stearine could no where be found.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SIR HUMPHRY DAVY ON WEATHER-OMENS.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>In his shepherd’s calling he was prompt,</div>
      <div class='line'>And watchful more than ordinary men.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes,</div>
      <div class='line'>When others heeded not, he heard the South</div>
      <div class='line'>Make subterraneous music, like the noise</div>
      <div class='line'>Of bagpipes upon distant Highland hills.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The late Sir Humphry Davy, one of the most successful
modern explorers of the secrets of nature, was not above attending
to, and explaining, the “weather-omens” which are
derived from popular observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his <cite>Salmonia</cite> he has the following dialogue between
Haliens, (a fly-fisher,) Poietes, (a poet,) Physicus, (a man of
science,) and Ornither, (a sportsman):—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span><i>Poiet.</i>—I hope we shall have another good day to-morrow,
for the clouds are red in the west.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Phys.</i>—I have no doubt of it, for the red has a tint of purple.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Hal.</i>—Do you know why this tint portends fine weather?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Phys.</i>—The air, when dry, I believe, refracts more red, or
heat-making rays; and as dry air is not perfectly transparent,
they are again refracted in the horizon. I have generally observed
a coppery or yellow sunset to foretell rain; but as an indication
of wet weather approaching, nothing is more certain
than a halo round the moon, which is produced by precipitated
water; and the larger the circle, the nearer the clouds, and
consequently the more ready to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Hal.</i>—I have often observed that the old proverb is correct,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd’s warning;</div>
      <div class='line'>A rainbow at night is the shepherd’s delight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Can you explain this omen?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Phys.</i>—A rainbow can only occur when the clouds containing
or depositing the rain are opposite the sun,—and in the
evening the rainbow is in the east, and in the morning in the
west; and as our heavy rains, in this climate, are usually
brought by the westerly wind, a rainbow in the west indicates
that the bad weather is on the road, by the wind, to us;
whereas the rainbow in the east proves that the rain in those
clouds is passing from us.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Poiet.</i>—I have often observed that when the swallows fly
high, fine weather is to be expected or continued; but when
they fly low, and close to the ground, rain is almost surely approaching.
Can you account for this?</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Hal.</i>—Swallows follow the flies and gnats, and flies and gnats
usually delight in warm strata of air; and as warm air is lighter,
and usually moister, than cold air, when the warm strata of air
are high, there is less chance of moisture being thrown down
from them by the mixture with cold air; but when the warm
and moist air is close to the surface, it is almost certain that, as
the cold air flows down into it, a deposition of water will take
place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><i>Poiet.</i>—I have often seen sea-gulls assemble on the land, and
have almost always observed that very stormy and rainy weather
was approaching. I conclude that these animals, sensible
of a current of air approaching from the ocean, retire to the
land to shelter themselves from the storm.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Orn.</i>—No such thing. The storm is their element, and the
little petrel enjoys the heaviest gale, because, living on the
smaller sea-insects, he is sure to find his food in the spray of a
heavy wave; and you may see him flitting above the edge of the
highest surge. I believe that the reason of this migration of
sea-gulls, and other sea-birds, to the land, is their security of
finding food; and they may be observed at this time feeding
greedily on the earth-worms and larvæ driven out of the
ground by severe floods; and the fish, on which they prey in
fine weather in the sea, leave the surface, and go deeper, in
storms. The search after food, as we have agreed on a former
occasion, is the principal cause why animals change their places.
The different tribes of the wading birds always migrate when
rain is about to take place; and I remember once, in Italy,
having been long waiting, in the end of March, for the arrival
of the double snipe in the Campagna of Rome, a great flight
appeared on the 3d of April, and the day after heavy rain set
in, which greatly interfered with my sport. The vulture, upon
the same principle, follows armies; and I have no doubt that
the augury of the ancients was a good deal founded upon the
observation of the instincts of birds. There are many superstitions
of the vulgar owing to the same source. For anglers,
in spring, it is always unlucky to see single magpies; but two
may be always regarded as a favorable omen; and the reason
is, that in cold and stormy weather one magpie alone leaves the
nest in search of food, the other remaining sitting upon the
eggs or the young ones; but when two go out together it is
only when the weather is warm and mild, and favorable for
fishing.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Poiet.</i>—The singular connections of causes and effects to
which you have just referred, make superstition less to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>wondered at, particularly amongst the vulgar; and when two
facts, naturally unconnected, have been accidentally coincident,
it is not singular that this coincidence should have been observed
and registered, and that omens of the most absurd kind
should be trusted in. In the west of England, half a century
ago, a particular hollow noise on the sea-coast was referred to a
spirit or goblin called Bucca, and was supposed to foretell a
shipwreck: the philosopher knows that sound travels much
faster than currents in the air, and the sound always foretold
the approach of a very heavy storm, which seldom takes place
on that wild and rocky coast without a shipwreck on some part
of its extensive shores, surrounded by the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is taken from <cite>The Shepherd’s Calendar</cite>, 1683:</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Signs of Rain, from Birds.</i>—Sea and fresh-water fowls, such
as cormorants, sea-gulls, moor-hens, &amp;c. flying from sea or the
fresh waters to land, show bad weather at hand; land fowls
flying to waters, and those shaking, washing, and noisy, especially
in the evening, denote the same; geese, ducks, coots, &amp;c.
picking, shaking, washing, and noisy; rooks and crows in
flocks and suddenly disappearing; pyes and jays in flocks and
very noisy; the raven or hooded-crow crying in the morning,
with an interruption in its notes, or crows being very clamorous
at evening; the heron, bittern, and swallow flying low;
birds forsaking their food and flying to their nests; poultry
going to rest or pigeons to their dove-house; tame fowls grubbing
in the dust and clapping their wings; small birds seeming
to duck and wash in the sand; the late and early crowing
of the cock, and clapping his wings; the early singing of woodlarks;
the early chirping of sparrows; the early note of the
chaffinch near houses; the dull appearance of robin-redbreast
near houses; peacocks and owls unusually clamorous.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Wind, from Birds.</i>—Sea and fresh-water fowls gathering
in flocks to the banks, and there sporting, especially in the
morning; wild geese flying high and in flocks, and directing
their course eastward; coots restless and clamorous; the hoopoe
loud in his note; the king’s fisher taking to land; rooks
darting or shooting in the air, or sporting on the banks of fresh
waters; and lastly, the appearance of the malefigie at sea, is a
certain forerunner of violent winds, and (early in the morning)
denotes horrible tempests at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Fair Weather, from Birds.</i>—Halcyons, sea-ducks, &amp;c.
leaving the land, and flocking to the sea; kites, herons, bitterns,
and swallows flying high, and loud in their notes; lapwings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>restless and clamorous; sparrows after sunrise restless and
noisy; ravens, hawks, and kestrils (in the morning) loud in
their notes; robin-redbreast mounted high, and loud in his
song; larks soaring high, and loud in their songs; owls hooting
with an easy and clear note; bats appearing early in the
evening.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Rain, from Beasts.</i>—Asses braying more frequently than
usual; hogs playing, scattering their food, or carrying straw in
their mouths; oxen snuffing the air, looking to the south,
while lying on their right sides, or licking their hoofs; cattle
gasping for air at noon; calves running violently and gamboling;
deer, sheep, or goats leaping, fighting, or pushing; cats
washing their face and ears; dogs eagerly scraping up earth;
foxes barking; rats and mice more restless than usual; a
grumbling noise in the belly of hounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Rain, from Insects.</i>—Worms crawling out of the earth in
great abundance; spiders falling from their webs; flies dull
and restless; ants hastening to their nests; bees hastening
home, and keeping close in their hives; frogs drawing nigh to
houses, and croaking from ditches; gnats singing more than
usual; but if gnats play in the open air, or if hornets, wasps,
and glow-worms appear plentifully in the evening, or if spiders’
webs are seen in the air or on the grass, these do all denote
fair and warm weather at hand.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Rain, from the Sun.</i>—Sun rising dim or waterish;
rising red with blackish beams mixed along with his rays;
rising in a musty or muddy color; rising red and turning
blackish; setting under a thick cloud; setting with a red sky
in the east.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sudden rains never last long; but when the air grows thick
by degrees, and the sun, moon, and stars shine dimmer and
dimmer, then it is like to rain six hours usually.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Wind, from the Sun.</i>—Sun rising pale and setting red,
with an iris; rising large in surface; rising with a red sky in
the north; setting of a blood color; setting pale, with one or
more dark circles, or accompanied with red streaks, seeming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>concave or hollow; seeming divided, great storms; parhelia, or
mock suns, never appear but are followed by tempest.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of Fair Weather, from the Sun.</i>—Sun rising clear, having
set clear the night before; rising while the clouds about him
are driving to the west; rising with an iris around him, and
that iris wearing away equally on all sides, then expect fair and
settled weather; rising clear and not hot; setting in red clouds,
according to the old observation,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The evening red and morning gray,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the sure sign of a fair day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>To the above may be added the following from a more recent
source:—</p>

<p class='c000'>As a rule, a circle around the moon indicates rain and wind.
When seen with a north or northeast wind, we may look for
stormy weather, especially if the circle be large; with the wind
in any other quarter, we may expect rain; so also when the
ring is small and the moon seems covered with mist. If, however,
the moon rise after sunset, and a circle be soon after
formed around it, no rain is foreboded. In the Netherlands
they have this proverb:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Julian calendar was framed about 46 years before Christ.
Cæsar made the year consist of 365 days; and the annual
excess of six hours, which amounted to one day in four years,
was taken into account by making every fourth year (leap-year)
consist of 366 days. But Cæsar’s correction of the
calendar was imperfect, being founded on the supposition that
the solar year consisted of 365 days, 6 hours, whereas the true
solar year consists of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45½ seconds.
Thus the Julian year exceeded the solar 11 minutes 14½
seconds,—which amounted to a whole day in 130 years. In
consequence of this inaccuracy, the vernal equinox, which
happened on the 25th of March in the time of Julius Cæsar,
had receded to the 21st of March in the year 325, and was
fixed to that day by the Council of Nice. Attempts were
afterwards made to effect some change in the calendar; but a
complete reformation was not made until 1582. Pope Gregory
XIII. invited to Rome the most learned astronomers of the
age; and, after the subject had been discussed ten years, it was
decreed that the vernal equinox, which had receded ten days
since the Council of Nice, and consequently happened on the
11th of March, should be brought back to the 21st of March,
and that for this purpose ten days should be taken from the
month of October, 1582. To avoid future deviation, it was
determined that instead of every 100th year being leap-year,
every 400th year only should be leap-year. By this plan—a
diminution of three days in 400 years—the error in the present
calendar will not exceed a day and a half in five thousand years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The calendar thus reformed by Pope Gregory was immediately
introduced into Catholic countries, but was not finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>adopted in Great Britain until 1752, when, by act of Parliament,
eleven days were struck out of the calendar, the 3d of
September being reckoned the 14th. The Greek Church still
obstinately adheres to the old style.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RESULTS OF THE CHANGE IN THE STYLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following happily-conceived address to the patrons of
“Poor Job’s Almanac” was occasioned by the change of the
style in 1752. The number of that year bears the title—</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Poor Job</cite>, 1752. <i>By Job Shepherd, philom. Newport.
Printed by James Franklin,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> at the Printing-office under the
Town School-house.</i> In this almanac the month of September
has, in the margin, the figures of the successive days, commencing
1, 2; and, after leaving blank a space for eleven
days, recommencing with 14, and continuing to the 30th.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Kind Reader</span>:—You have now such a year as you never
saw before, nor will see hereafter, the King and Parliament
of Great Britain having thought proper to enact that the
month of September, 1752, shall contain but nineteen days,
which will shorten this year eleven days, and have extended
the same throughout the British dominions; so that we are not
to have two beginnings to our years, but the first of January is
to be the first day and the first month of the year 1752; eleven
days are taken from September, and begin 1, 2, 14, 15, &amp;c. Be
not astonished, nor look with concern, dear reader, at such a
deduction of days, nor regret as for the loss of so much time;
but take this for your consolation, that your expenses will perhaps
appear lighter, and your mind be more at ease. And
what an indulgence is here for those who love their pillows, to
lie down in peace on the second of this month, and not perhaps
awake or be disturbed till the fourteenth, in the morning!
And, reader, this is not to hasten the payment of debts, freedom
of apprentices or servants, or the coming to age of minors;
but the number of natural days in all agreements are to be fulfilled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>All Church holidays and Courts are to be on the same
nominal days they were before; but fairs, after the second of
September, alter the nominal days, and so seemed to be held
eleven days later. Now, reader, since ’tis likely you may never
have such another year nor such another almanac, I would advise
you to improve the one for your own sake, and I recommend
the other for the sake of your friend,</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c012'>MIND YOUR P’S AND Q’S.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It would be a curious thing, if they could be traced out, to
ascertain the origin of half the quaint old sayings and maxims
that have come down to the present time from unknown generations.
Who, for example, was “<span class='sc'>Dick</span>,” who had the odd-looking
“hat-band,” and who has so long been the synonym
or representative of oddly-acting people? Who knows any
thing authentic of the leanness of “Job’s turkey,” who has
so many followers in the ranks of humanity? Scores of
other sayings there are, concerning which similar questions
might be asked. Who ever knew, until comparatively late
years, what was the origin of the cautionary saying, “Mind
your P’s and Q’s”? A modern antiquarian, however, has put
the world right in relation to <i>that</i> saying. In ale-houses, in the
olden time, when chalk “scores” were marked upon the wall,
or behind the door of the tap-room, it was customary to put the
initials “P” and “Q” at the head of every man’s account, to
show the number of “pints” and “quarts” for which he was
in arrears; and we may presume many a friendly rustic to have
tapped his neighbor on the shoulder, when he was indulging
too freely in his potations, and to have exclaimed, as he pointed
to the chalk-score, “Mind your P’s and Q’s, man! mind your
P’s and Q’s!” The writer from whom we glean this information
mentions an amusing anecdote in connection with it,
which had its origin in London, at the time a “Learned Pig”
was attracting the attention of half the town. A theatrical
wag, who attended the porcine performances, maliciously set
before the four-legged actor some <i>peas</i>,—a temptation which the
animal could not resist, and which immediately occasioned him
to lose the “cue” given him by the showman. The pig-exhibitor
remonstrated with the author of the mischief on the unfairness
of what he had done; to which he replied, “I only
wanted to ascertain whether the pig knew his ‘peas’ from his
‘cues!’”</p>

      <div class='line'>April the First stands marked by custom’s rules,</div>
      <div class='line'>A day of being, and of making, fools.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The First of April, as is well known, is distinguished in the
calendar by the singular appellation of “<i>All Fools’ Day</i>.” It
would be a curious exception to common experience, if, on the
recurrence of this memorable epoch in the division of time,
multitudes were not betrayed into a due observance of its
peculiarities. Many grave and unsuspecting people have
been sent upon the most frivolous and nonsensical errands.
Many a passer-by has been told that there was something
out of his pocket, which was his hand; or something on his
face, which was his nose. Many a school-boy has been sent to
the shoemaker’s for stirrup-oil, which he would get from a strap,
across his shoulders; or to ask a schoolmistress for the biography
of Eve’s mother; or to an old bachelor to purchase pigeon’s
milk. Many a printer’s “devil” has been sent to a neighboring
editor for a quart of editorial, and received in return a picture
of a jackass; and many a pretty girl despatched to the
handsome druggist round the corner for the essence of tulips
(two-lips,) which she would sometimes box the pharmaceutic ears
for offering to give her. Some would be summoned, upon the
most unfounded pretexts, out of their warm beds, an hour or
more before the accustomed time. Others were enticed to open
packages, promising ample remuneration, but full of disappointment;
and others again, as they passed along the streets, were
captivated by the sight of pieces of spurious coin, which, when
they essayed to lift, they found securely fastened to the pavement,—together
with various other whimsicalities, which under other
circumstances would have been deemed highly offensive, but,
happening on the First of April, were considered, if not agreeable,
at least comparatively harmless. The <i>origin</i> of this
strange custom is shrouded in mystery. It has been traced by
some to the scene in the life of Jesus when he was sent from
Pilate to Herod, and back from Herod to Pilate, which occurred
about this period.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>Brady’s <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clavis Calendaria</span></cite>, published in 1812, mentions
that more than a century previous the almanacs designated the
First of April as “All Fools’ Day.” In the northern counties
of England and Scotland, the jokes on that day were practised
to a great extent, and it scarcely required an apology to experiment
upon the gravest and most respectable of city or country
gentlemen and women. The person whose good nature or simplicity
put him momentarily in the power of his facetious neighbor
was called a “<i>gowk</i>”—and the sending upon ridiculous
errands, “<i>hunting the gowk</i>.” The term “<i>gowk</i>” was a common
expression for a cuckoo, which was reckoned among the
silliest and simplest of all the feathered tribes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In France, the person made the butt upon these occasions
was styled “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un poisson d’Avril</span></i>”—that is, an April fish—by
implication, an April fool—“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poisson d’Avril</span></i>,” the familiar
name of the <i>mackerel</i>, a fish easily caught by deception, singly
and in shoals, at this season of the year. The term “April
fool” was therefore, probably, nothing more than an easy substitution
of that opprobrious epithet for fish, and it is quite likely
that our ancestors borrowed the custom from France, with this
change in the phrase peculiar to the occasion. It is possible,
however, that it may have been derived from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poison</span></i>, mischief.
Among the French, ridicule is the most successful weapon for
correcting folly and holding vice in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terrorem</span></i>. A Frenchman
is more afraid of a successful <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</span></i> at his expense than of a
sword, and the First of April is a day, therefore, of which he
can make a double application: he may gratify his love of
pleasantry among his friends, or inflict a severe wound on his
enemies, if he possess the art and wit to invent and perpetrate
a worthy piece of foolery upon them. One of the best tricks
that ever occurred in France was that of Rabelais, who fooled
the officers of justice, when he had no money, into conveying
him from Marseilles to Paris on a charge of treason got up for
the purpose, and, when arrived there, showing them how they
were hoaxed. For this purpose he made up some brick-dust
and ashes in different packets, labelled as poisons for the royal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>family of France. The bait took, and he was conveyed to the
capital as a traitor, seven hundred miles, only to explain the
joke.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a very common practical joke on fools’ day in the
British metropolis: it consists in despatching a letter by an
unlucky dupe, who is to wait for an answer. The answer is a
second note, to a third person, “to send the fool farther.” A
young surgeon, a greenhorn in practice, fresh from St. Bartholomew’s,
his instruments unfleshed on his own account, and
his surgery bottles full to repletion, was called a few years ago
from the Strand to a patient in Newgate Street, very rich,
named Dobbs. It was the First of April, and it was his first
patient. The young Esculapius was ushered into the presence
of the supposed patient, who was busy writing in his counting-house.
The surgeon explained his errand, and Mr. Dobbs,
having an excellent mercantile discernment, soon saw through
the affair. He bowed and said, “It is a mistake, sir: my name
is Dobbs, but I am, thank God, hale and hearty. It is my
brother, the sugar-baker, on Fish Street Hill, that has sent for
you, [carriage or horse he had none,] three-fourths of a mile
farther.” He entered among the pyramids of snowy sweets, and
found Mr. Dobbs, the sugar-baker, of Fish Street Hill, as hale
as his brother of Newgate Street. The refiner of saccharine
juice understood his brother’s note, stammered out a pretended
apology for the mistake, and said he supposed, as the young
man’s directions were to Mr. J. Dobbs, and not Mr. Jeffry
Dobbs, that was intended; that his name was Jeffry, but his
brother John, a third member of the family, and in his business,
lived at Limehouse, whither he thought, if our surgeon
proceeded, he would find the person he sought. An address
was handed the young tourniquet at the extreme end of Limehouse,
which address, it is needless to say, was false. What
will not a surgeon do to obtain his first patient, and a rich one
too? Away he posted to Limehouse, and soon found how far
he had travelled for nothing. Tired and disappointed, and
scheming vengeance on the authors of the hoax, he set off on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>his return home, cursing the Dobbs family every step he went.
As he passed along Upper Shadwell, he saw a horse gallop furiously
down Chamomile Street and fling its rider a heavy fall
on the pavement. He ran and lifted the fallen man, whom he
found insensible. He conveyed him to a shop hard by, bled
him, and had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes. Suffice
it to say that, on being conveyed home, our young surgeon
attended him until he was restored to health; and so
gratefully were his exertions received by the stranger, who was a
rich East India merchant, far advanced in life, that he took
him into his house as a medical attendant and friend, and ultimately
left him the bulk of his property. Thus, out of an intended
Fools’ Day hoax, by the inscrutable caprice of fortune, a
frolic led its dupe to wealth. This anecdote, according to the
London Athenæum, may be depended on as true, nothing in
the story but the name adopted, to conceal the real actors in
the drama, being fictitious.</p>

<p class='c000'>A day of fooleries, the <i>Huli Fest</i>, is observed, also, among
the Hindoos, attended with the like silly species of witticism.</p>

<p class='c000'>By many it is believed that the term “<i>all</i>” is a corruption
of <i><span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">auld</span></i> or <i>old</i>, thereby making it originally “Old Fools’ Day,”
in confirmation of which opinion the following observation is
quoted from an ancient Roman calendar respecting the 1st of
November:—“The feast of old fools is removed to this day.”
The oldest almanacs extant, however, have it <i>all</i> (and not <i>old</i>)
fools’ day. Besides the Roman “Saturnalia” and the Druidical
rites, superstitions which the early Christians found in
existence when they commenced their labors in England, was
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Festum Fatuorum</span></i>, or <i>Fools’ Holiday</i>, which was doubtless
our present First of April. In some of the German classics
frequent mention is made of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aprilen Narr</span></i>, so that even
the Germans of the olden time understood how to practise their
cunning April arts upon their neighbors quite as well as we of
the present day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Enough has been here quoted to prove that the custom is of
very ancient existence; but the precise <i>origin</i> thereof remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>undiscovered, and will have to be dug from some of the musty
chronicles of gray antiquity. But, be the origin of the custom
what it may, we cannot avoid the conclusion that it is one
“more honored in the breach than in the observance.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CARDS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>About the year 1390, cards were invented to divert Charles
IV., then King of France, who was fallen into a melancholy
disposition. That they were not in use before appears highly
probable. 1st, Because no cards are to be seen in any paintings,
sculpture, tapestry, &amp;c. more ancient than the preceding
period, but are represented in many works of ingenuity since
that age. 2dly, No prohibitions relative to cards, by the king’s
edicts, are mentioned; although some few years before, a most
severe one was published, forbidding by name all manner of
sports and pastimes, in order that the subjects might exercise
themselves in shooting with bows and arrows and be in a condition
to oppose the English. Now, it is not to be presumed
that so luring a game as cards would have been omitted in the
enumeration had they been in use. 3dly, In all the ecclesiastical
canons prior to the same time, there occurs no mention
of cards; although, twenty years after that date, card-playing
was interdicted the clergy by a Gallican Synod. About the
same time is found in the account-book of the king’s cofferer
the following charge:—“Paid for a pack of painted leaves
bought for the king’s amusement, three livres.” Printing and
stamping being not then discovered, the cards were painted,
which made them dear. Thence, in the above synodical canons,
they are called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pagillæ pictæ</span></i>, painted little leaves. 4thly,
About thirty years after this came a severe edict against cards
in France, and another by Emanuel, Duke of Savoy, only
permitting the ladies this pastime, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pro spinilis</span></i>, for pins and
needles.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Of their designs.</i>—The inventor proposed by the figures of
the four suits, or colors, as the French call them, to represent
the four states or classes of men in the kingdom. By the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cæsars</span></i> (hearts) are meant the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gens de Chœur</span></i>, choir-men, or
ecclesiastics; and therefore the Spaniards, who certainly received
the use of cards from the French, have <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">copas</span></i> or chalices
instead of hearts. The nobility, or prime military part of the
kingdom, are represented by the ends or points of lances, or
pikes; and our ignorance of the meaning or resemblance of the
figure induced us to call them spades. The Spaniards have
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">espadas</span></i> (swords) in lieu of pikes, which is of similar import.
By diamonds are designated the order of citizens, merchants,
and tradesmen, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carraux</span></i>, (square stone tiles, or the like.) The
Spaniards have a coin <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">dineros</span></i>, which answers to it; and the
Dutch call the French word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carreaux</span></i>, <i><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">stieneen</span></i>, stones and diamonds,
from the form. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Treste</span></i>, the trefoil leaf, or clover grass,
(corruptly called clubs,) alludes to husbandmen and peasants.
How this suit came to be called clubs is not explained, unless,
borrowing the game from the Spaniards, who have <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">bastos</span></i> (staves
or clubs) instead of the trefoil, we gave the Spanish signification
to the French figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “history of the four kings,” which the French in drollery
sometimes call “the cards,” is that of <i>David</i>, <i>Alexander</i>,
<i>Cæsar</i>, and <i>Charles</i>, names which were, and still are, on the
French cards. These respective names represent the four celebrated
monarchies of the Jews, Greeks, Romans, and Franks
under Charlemagne.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the queens are intended <i>Argine</i>, <i>Esther</i>, <i>Judith</i>, and
<i>Pallas</i>, (names retained in the French cards,) typical of birth,
piety, fortitude, and wisdom, the qualifications residing in each
person. “Argine” is an anagram for “Regina,” queen by
descent.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the knaves were designed the servants to knights, (for
knave originally meant only servant; and in an old translation
of the Bible, St. Paul is called the knave of Christ,) but French
pages and valets, now indiscriminately used by various orders
of persons, were formerly only allowed to persons of quality,
esquires, (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">escuiers</span>,) shield or armor bearers. Others fancy
that the knights themselves were designed by those cards, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span><i>Hogier</i> and <i>Lahire</i>, two names on the French cards,
were famous knights at the time cards were supposed to be
invented.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SUB ROSA.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But when we with caution a secret disclose,</div>
      <div class='line'>We cry, “Be it spoken, sir, under the rose.”</div>

      <div class='line'>Whose leaves by their closeness taught secrets to hold;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’twas thence it was painted on tables so oft</div>
      <div class='line'>As a warning, lest, when with a frankness men scoft</div>

      <div class='line in38'><cite>British Apollo</cite>, 1708.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The origin of the phrase <i>under the rose</i> implies secrecy, and
had its origin during the year <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 477, at which time Pausanias,
the commander of the confederate fleet of the Spartans
and Athenians, was engaged in an intrigue with Xerxes for the
subjugation of Greece to the Persian rule, and for the hand of
the monarch’s daughter in marriage. Their negotiations were
carried on in a building attached to the temple of Minerva,
called the Brazen House, the roof of which was a garden forming
a bower of roses; so that the plot, which was conducted
with the utmost secrecy, was literally matured <i>under the rose</i>.
Pausanias, however, was betrayed by one of his emissaries,
who, by a preconcerted plan with the ephori, (the overseers
and counsellors of state, five in number,) gave them a secret
opportunity to hear from the lips of Pausanias himself the acknowledgment
of his treason. To escape arrest, he fled to the
temple of Minerva, and, as the sanctity of the place forbade intrusion
for violence or harm of any kind, the people walled up
the edifice with stones and left him to die of starvation. His
own mother laid the first stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>It afterward became a custom among the Athenians to wear
roses in their hair whenever they wished to communicate to
another a secret which they wished to be kept inviolate. Hence
the saying <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosa</span></i> among them, and, since, among Christian
nations.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>OVER THE LEFT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The earliest trace of the use and peculiar significance of this
phrase may be found in the <cite>Records</cite> of the Hartford County
Courts, in the (then) Colony of Connecticut, as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whereas James Steel did commence an action against Bevell
Waters (both of Hartford) in this Court, upon hearing and
tryall whereof the Court gave judgment against the said Waters,
(as in justice they think they ought,) upon the declaring
the said judgment, the said Waters did review to the Court in
March next, that, being granted and entered, the said Waters,
as he departed from the table, he said, “<i>God bless you over the

<p class='c000'>The Court order a record to be made thereof forthwith.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the next court, Waters was tried for contempt, for saying
the words recited, “so cursing the Court,” and on verdict
fined £5. He asked a review of the Court following, which
was granted; and pending trial, the Court asked counsel of the
Rev. Messrs. Woodbridge and Buckingham, the ministers of
the Hartford churches, as to the “common acceptation” of the
offensive phrase. Their reply constitutes a part of the <cite>Record</cite>,
and is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>We are of opinion that those words, said on the other side to
be spoken by Bevell Waters, include (1) prophaneness, by
using the name of God, that is holy, with such ill words whereto
it was joyned; (2) that they carry great contempt in them,
arising to the degree of an imprecation or curse, the words of a
curse being the most contemptible that can ordinarily be used.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>KICKING THE BUCKET.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The tradition among the slang fraternity as to the origin of
this phrase is that “One Bolsover, having hung himself to a
beam while standing on the bottom of a pail, or bucket, kicked
the vessel away in order to pry into futurity, and it was all UP
with him from that moment—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Finis!</span></i>”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BUMPER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When the Roman Catholic religion was in the ascendant in
England, the health of the Pope was usually drunk in a full
glass immediately after dinner—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au bon père</span></i>: hence the word
“Bumper.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ROYAL SAYING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It was Alphonsus, surnamed the Wise, King of Aragon, who
used to say, “That among so many things as are by men possessed
or pursued in the course of their lives, all the rest are
baubles, besides old wood to burn, old wine to drink, old friends
to converse with, and old books to read.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DUN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This word, generally supposed to be derived from the French
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donnez</span></i>, owes its origin, according to the British Apollo of September,
1708, to one <i>Joe Dun</i>, a famous bailiff of Lincoln in
the time of Henry VII. He is said to have been so extremely
shrewd in the management of his rough business, and
so dexterous in the collection of dues, that his name became
proverbial; and whenever a man refused to pay his debts, it
grew into a prevalent custom to say, “Why don’t you <span class='sc'>Dun</span>
him?”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HUMBUG.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the many issues of base coin which from time to time
were made in Ireland, there was none to be compared in worthlessness
to that made by James II. at the Dublin Mint. It was
composed of any thing on which he could lay his hands, such as
lead, pewter, copper, and brass, and so low was its intrinsic
value that twenty shillings of it was only worth twopence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>sterling. William III., a few days after the battle of the Boyne,
ordered that the crown-piece and half-crown should be taken
as one penny and one half-penny respectively. The soft mixed
metal of which that worthless coin was composed was known
among the Irish as Uim bog, pronounced Oom-bug, i.e. soft
copper, i.e. worthless money; and in the course of their dealings
the modern use of the word <i>humbug</i> took its rise, as in the
phrases, “That’s a <i>piece of uimbog</i>,” “Don’t think to <i>pass off
your uimbog</i> on me.” Hence the word <i>humbug</i> came to be
applied to any thing that had a specious appearance but which
was in reality spurious. It is curious to note that the very
opposite of <i>humbug</i>, i.e. false metal, is the word <i>sterling</i>, which
is also taken from a term applied to the <i>true</i> coinage of Great
Britain, as <i>sterling</i> coin, <i>sterling</i> worth, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PASQUINADES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>At one corner of the Palazzo Braschi, the last monument of
Papal nepotism, near the Piazza Navona, in Rome, stands the
famous mutilated torso known as the statue of Pasquin. It is
the remains of a work of art of considerable merit, found at this
spot, in the sixteenth century, and supposed to represent Ajax
supporting Menelaus. It derives its modern name from the
tailor Pasquin, who kept a shop opposite, which was the rendezvous
of all the gossips in the city, and from which their
satirical witticisms on the manners and follies of the day obtained
a ready circulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Misson says in his Travels in Italy,—The tailor had precisely
the talent to head a regiment of satirical wits, and had he had
time to publish, he would have been the Peter Pindar of his
day; but his genius seems to have been satisfied to rest cross-legged
on his shop-board. When any lampoons or amusing
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mots</span></i> were current in Rome, they were usually called, from
his shop, <i>Pasquinades</i>. After his death, this statue of an ancient
gladiator was found under the pavement of his shop. It
was soon set up, and by universal consent was inscribed with
his name; and they still attempt to raise him from the dead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>and keep the caustic tailor alive, in the marble gladiator of
wit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The statue of Marforio, which stood near the arch of Septimus
Severus, in the Forum, was made the vehicle for replying
to the attacks of Pasquin; and for many years they kept up an
incessant fire of wit and repartee. When Marforio was removed
to the museum in the capitol, the Pope wished to remove
Pasquin also; but the Duke di Braschi, to whom he belongs,
would not permit it. Adrian VI. attempted to arrest his career
by ordering the statue to be burnt and thrown into the Tiber;
but one of the Pope’s friends, Ludovico Sussano, saved him, by
suggesting that his ashes would turn into frogs, and croak more
terribly than before. It is said that his owner is compelled to
pay a fine whenever he is found guilty of exhibiting any scandalous
placards. The modern Romans seem to regard Pasquin
as part of their social system: in the absence of a free press,
he has become in some measure the organ of public opinion,
and there is scarcely an event upon which he does not pronounce
judgment. Some of his sayings are extremely broad for the
atmosphere of Rome, but many of them are very witty, and
fully maintain the character of his fellow-citizens for satirical
epigrams and repartee. When Mezzofanti, the great linguist,
was made a cardinal, Pasquin declared that it was a very proper
appointment, for there could be no doubt that the “Tower
of Babel,” “<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il torre di Babel</span></i>” required an interpreter. At
the time of the first French occupation of Italy, Pasquin gave
out the following satirical dialogue:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">I Francesi son tutti ladri.</span></div>

      <div class='line'>Not all—but Bonaparte.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another remarkable saying is recorded in connection with
the celebrated bull of Urban VIII., excommunicating all persons
who took snuff in the Cathedral of Seville. On the publication
of this decree, Pasquin appropriately quoted the beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>passage in Job,—“Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?
and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Alexander Newell, Dean of St. Paul’s and Master of Westminster
School in the reign of Queen Mary, was an excellent
angler. But, (says Fuller,) while Newell was catching of fishes,
Bishop Bonner was catching of Newell, and would certainly
have sent him to the shambles had not a good London merchant
conveyed him away upon the seas. Newell was fishing
upon the banks of the Thames when he received the first intimation
of his danger, which was so pressing that he dared not
go back to his own house to make any preparation for his
flight. Like an honest angler, he had taken with him provision
for the day, and when, in the first year of England’s deliverance,
he returned to his country and his old haunts, he remembered
that on the day of his flight he had left a bottle
of beer in a safe place on the bank: there he looked for it, and
“found it no bottle, but a gun—such the sound at the opening
thereof; and this (adds Fuller,) is believed (casualty is mother
of more invention than industry) the origin of Bottled
Ale in England.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE POTATO.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Although Sir Walter Raleigh was unexpectedly prevented
from accompanying Sir Humphrey Gilbert to Newfoundland,
he eventually proved one of the greatest benefactors to his own
country, by the introduction of the potato on his return from
America, in the year 1584. This root was first planted on Sir
Walter’s estate at Youghall, which he afterward sold to the
Earl of Cork; but not having given sufficient directions to the
person who had the management of the land, the latter mistook
the flowers for the fruit and most valuable part of the plant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>and, on tasting them, rejected them as a pernicious exotic.
Some time afterwards, turning up the earth, he found the roots
spread to a great distance, and in considerable quantities; and
from this stock the whole kingdom was soon after supplied with
this valuable plant, which gradually spread throughout Europe
and North America. Its name, <i>potato</i>, in Irish <i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">paitey</span></i>, and in
French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">patate</span></i>, is said to be derived from the original language
of Mexico, of which it is supposed to be a native.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TARRING AND FEATHERING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Anquetil, in his <cite>Histoire de France</cite>, 1805, has the following
passage in reference to this mode of chastisement:—</p>

<p class='c000'>They (the two crusading kings, Richard Cœur de Lion and
Philip Augustus) afterwards made in concert the laws of police
which should be observed in both their armies. No women,
except washerwomen, were to be permitted to accompany the
troops. Whoever killed another was, according to the place
where the crime should be committed, to be cast into the sea,
or buried alive, bound to the corpse of the murdered person.
Whoever wounded another was to have his hand cut off; whoever
struck another should be plunged three times into the
sea; and whoever committed theft should have <i>warm pitch
poured over his head, which should then be powdered with
feathers</i>, and the offender should afterwards be left abandoned
on the first shore.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STOCKINGS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is stated that Henry the Second, of France, was the first
who wore silk stockings, and this was on the occasion of his
sister’s wedding to the Duke of Savoy, in 1509. Howell, in
his <cite>History of the World</cite>, says that, in 1550, Queen Elizabeth
was presented with a pair of black silk knit stockings by her
silk-woman, Mrs. Montague, and that she never wore cloth ones
afterward. He also adds, that Henry the Eighth wore ordinarily
cloth hose, unless there came from Spain, by great
chance, a pair of silk stockings. His son, Edward the Sixth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>was presented with a pair of long Spanish silk stockings by
Sir Thomas Gresham. Hence it would seem that knit
stockings originally came from Spain. It is stated that one
William Rider, an apprentice on London Bridge, seeing, at
the house of an Italian merchant, a pair of knit stockings,
from Mantua, took the hint, and made a pair exactly like them,
which he presented to the Earl of Pembroke, and that they
were the first of that kind worn in England. There have been
various opinions with respect to the original invention of the
stocking-frame; but it is now generally conceded that it was
invented during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, in the year 1589,
by William Lee, M.A., of St. John’s College, Cambridge.
In the <cite>London Magazine</cite>, it is related that Mr. Lee was expelled
from the University for marrying, contrary to the statutes
of the college. Being thus rejected, and ignorant of any other
means of subsistence, he was reduced to the necessity of living
upon what his wife could earn by knitting stockings, which
gave a spur to his invention; and, by curiously observing the
working of the needles in knitting, he formed in his mind the
model of the frame. Mr. Lee went to France, and, for want
of patronage there and in England, died of a broken heart, at

  <h3 class='c012'>DRINKING HEALTHS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The drinking of healths originated during the Danish occupation
of Britain. The Danes frequently stabbed Englishmen
while in the act of drinking, and it finally became necessary
for the English, in view of the constant repetition of this
dastardly mode of assassination, to enter into a compact to be
mutual pledges of security for each other’s health and preservation.
Hence the custom of pledging and drinking
healths.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A FEATHER IN ONE’S CAP.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the Lansdowne MS., British Museum, is a <cite>Description of
Hungary in 1599</cite>, in which the writer says of the inhabitants,
“It hath been an antient custom among them that none should
wear a fether but he who had killed a Turk, to whom onlie y<sup>t</sup>
was lawful to shew the number of his slaine enemys by the
number of fethers in his cappe.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE WORD BOOK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Before paper came into general use, our Teutonic forefathers
wrote their letters, calendars, and accounts on wood. The <i>Boc</i>,
or beech, being close-grained and plentiful in Northern Europe,
was generally employed for the purpose; and hence the word
<i>book</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NINE TAILORS MAKE A MAN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following humorous account of the origin of this saying
is from <cite>The British Apollo</cite>. “It happened (’tis no great matter
in what year) that eight tailors, having finished considerable
pieces of work at the house of a certain person of quality,
(whose name authors have thought fit to conceal,) and received
all the money due for the same, a virago servant-maid of the
house, observing them to be but slender-built animals, and in
their mathematical postures on their shop-board appearing but so
many pieces of men, resolved to encounter and pillage them on
the road. The better to compass her design, she procured a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>very terrible great black pudding, which, having waylaid them,
she presented at the breast of the foremost. They, mistaking
this prop of life for an instrument of death, at least a blunderbuss,
readily yielded up their money; but she, not contented
with that, severely disciplined them with a cudgel she carried
in the other hand, all which they bore with a philosophical resignation.
Thus, eight, not being able to deal with one woman,
by consequence could not make a man; on which account a
ninth is added. ’Tis the opinion of our curious virtuosos, that
their want of courage ariseth from their immoderate eating of
cucumbers, which too much refrigerates their blood. However,
to their eternal honor be it spoken, they have often been known
to encounter a sort of cannibals, to whose assaults they are often
subject, not fictitious, but real man-eaters, and that with a
lance but two inches long; nay, and although they go armed
no further than their middle finger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An earlier authority than the preceding may be found in a
note in <cite>Democritus in London, with the Mad Pranks and
Comical Conceits of Motley and Robin Goodfellow</cite>, in which
the following version of the origin of the saying is given. It
is dated 1682:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There is a proverb which has been of old,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many men have likewise been so told,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the discredit of the Taylor’s Trade:</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Nine Taylors go to make up a man</i>, they said;</div>
      <div class='line'>But for their credit I’ll unriddle it t’ ye:</div>
      <div class='line'>A draper once fell into povertie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nine Taylors joined their purses together then,</div>
      <div class='line'>To set him up, and make him a man again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>VIZ.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The contraction <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> affords a curious instance of the universality
of arbitrary signs. There are few people now who do not
readily comprehend the meaning of that useful particle,—a certain
publican excepted, who, being furnished with a list of the
requirements of a festival in which the word appeared, apologized
for the omission of one of the items enumerated: he informed
the company that he had inquired throughout the town
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>for some viz., but he had not been able to procure it. He was,
however, readily excused for his inability to do so. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viȝ.</span>
being a contraction of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">videlicet</span></i>, the terminal sign ȝ was never
intended to represent the letter “z,” but was simply a mark or
sign of abbreviation. It is now always written and expressed
as a “z” and will doubtless continue to be so.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SIGNATURE OF THE CROSS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The mark which persons who are unable to write are required to
make instead of their signatures, is in the form of a cross; and this
practice, having formerly been followed by kings and nobles, is
constantly referred to as an instance of the deplorable ignorance
of ancient times. This signature is not, however, invariably a
proof of such ignorance. Anciently the use of the mark was not
confined to illiterate persons; for among the Saxons the mark
of the cross, as an attestation of the good faith of the persons
signing, was required to be attached to the signature of those
who <i>could</i> write, as well as to stand in the place of the signature
of those who could not write. In those times, if a man
could write, or even read, his knowledge was considered proof
presumptive that he was in holy orders. The clericus, or clerk,
was synonymous with penman; and the laity, or people who
were not clerks, did not feel any urgent necessity for the use
of letters. The ancient use of the cross was therefore universal,
alike by those who could and those who could not write:
it was, indeed, the symbol of an oath, from its sacred associations,
as well as <i>the mark</i> generally adopted. Hence the origin
of the expression “God save the mark,” as a form of ejaculation
approaching the character of an oath.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE TURKISH CRESCENT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When Philip of Macedon approached by night with his
troops to scale the walls of Byzantium, the <i>moon</i> shone out and
discovered his design to the besieged, who repulsed him. The
crescent was afterwards adopted as the favorite badge of the
city. When the Turks took Byzantium, they found the crescent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>in every public place, and, believing it to possess some
magical power, adopted it themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The origin of the crescent as a religious emblem is anterior
to the time of Philip of Macedon, dating, in fact, from the very
beginning of history.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>POSTPAID ENVELOPES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>M. Piron tells us that the idea of a postpaid envelope originated
early in the reign of Louis XIV., with M. de Valfyer,
who, in 1653, established (with royal approbation) a private
penny-post, placing boxes at the corners of the streets for
the reception of letters wrapped up in envelopes, which were
to be bought at offices established for that purpose. M. de
Valfyer also had printed certain <i>forms</i> of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets</span></i>, or notes,
applicable to the ordinary business among the inhabitants of
great towns, with blanks, which were to be filled up by the pen
with such special matter as might complete the writer’s object.
One of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets</span></i> has been preserved to our times by a pleasant
misapplication of it. Pélisson (Mdme. de Sévigné’s friend,
and the object of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</span></i> that “he abused the privilege
which men have of being ugly”) was amused at this kind of
skeleton correspondence; and under the affected name of <i>Pisandre</i>,
(according to the pedantic fashion of the day,) he filled
up and addressed one of these forms to the celebrated Mademoiselle
de Scuderie, in her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pseudonyme</span></i> of <i>Sappho</i>. This
strange <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billet-doux</span></i> has happened, from the celebrity of the parties,
to be preserved, and it is still extant,—one of the oldest,
it is presumed, of penny-post letters, and a curious example of
a <i>pre</i>paying envelope, a new proof of the adage that “there
is nothing new under the sun.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OLD HUNDRED.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The history of this old psalm-tune, which almost every one
has been accustomed to hear ever since he can remember, is
the subject of a work recently written by an English clergyman.
Luther has generally been considered the author of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>“Old Hundred,” but it has been pretty satisfactorily ascertained
that it was composed in the sixteenth century, and certainly
previous to 1546, by William Franc, a German. In the course
of time its arrangement has undergone repeated alterations;
and it is said that, as it originally appeared, it was of a more
lively character than at present. Many of these alterations
have been carefully preserved and may be seen by reference to
Moore’s <cite>Encyclopædia of Music</cite>. The oldest copy of it that
has been preserved was published in France, in Marot and
Beza’s Psalms, 1550. Subjoined is a faithful transcript of its
original adaptation to the 134th Psalm. It contrasts as broadly
with the present style of musical notation as does the English
of Chaucer with that of Noah Webster.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LA MARSEILLAISE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Rouget de Lisle was a young officer of engineers at Strasbourg.
He was born at <i>Lons-le-Saulnier</i>, in the <i>Jura</i> a country
of reverie and energy, as mountains commonly are. He relieved
the tediousness of a garrison-life by writing verses and
indulging a love of music. He was a frequent visitor at the
house of the Baron de Diedrich, a noble Alsacian of the constitutional
party, the Mayor of Strasbourg. The family loved the
young officer, and gave new inspiration to his heart in its attachment
to music and poetry, and the ladies were in the habit
of assisting, by their performances, the early conceptions of his
genius. A famine prevailed at Strasbourg in the winter of
1792. The house of Diedrich was rich at the beginning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>revolution, but had now become poor under the calamities and
sacrifices of the time. Its frugal table had always a hospitable
place for Rouget de Lisle. He was there morning and evening
as a son and brother. One day, when only some slices of
ham smoked upon the table, with a supply of camp-bread, Diedrich
said to De Lisle, in sad serenity, “Plenty is not found
at our meals. But no matter: enthusiasm is not wanting at
our civic festivals, and our soldiers’ hearts are full of courage.
We have one more bottle of Rhine wine in the cellar. Let us
have it, and we’ll drink to liberty and the country. Strasbourg
will soon have a patriotic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i>, and De Lisle must draw from
these last drops one of his hymns that will carry his own ardent
feelings to the soul of the people.” The young ladies applauded
the proposal. They brought the wine, and continued to fill the
glasses of Diedrich and the young officer until the bottle was
empty. The night was cold. De Lisle’s head and heart were
warm. He found his way to his lodgings, entered his solitary
chamber, and sought for inspiration at one moment in the palpitations
of his citizen’s heart, and at another by touching, as
an artist, the keys of his instrument, and striking out alternately
portions of an air and giving utterance to poetic
thoughts. He did not himself know which came first; it was
impossible for him to separate the poetry from the music, or the
sentiment from the words in which it was clothed. He sang
altogether, and wrote nothing. In this state of lofty inspiration,
he went to sleep with his head upon the instrument. The
chants of the night came upon him in the morning like the
faint impressions of a dream. He wrote down the words, made
the notes of the music, and ran to Diedrich’s. He found him
in the garden digging winter lettuces. The wife of the patriot
mayor was not yet up. Diedrich awoke her. They called together
some friends, who were, like themselves, passionately
fond of music, and able to execute the compositions of De Lisle.
One of the young ladies played, and Rouget sang. At the first
Stanza, the countenances of the company grew pale; at the
second, tears flowed abundantly; at the last, a delirium of enthusiasm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>broke forth. Diedrich, his wife, and the young officer
cast themselves into each others’ arms. The hymn of the
nation was found. Alas! it was destined to become a hymn of
terror. The unhappy Diedrich a few months afterwards marched
to the scaffold at the sound of the notes first uttered at his hearth,
from the heart of his friend and the voice of his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new song, executed some days afterwards publicly at
Strasbourg, flew from town to town through all the orchestras.
Marseilles adopted it to be sung at the opening and adjournment
of the clubs. Hence it took the name of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</span>
Hymn</cite>. The old mother of De Lisle, a loyalist and a religious
person, alarmed at the reverberation of her son’s name, wrote
to him, “What is the meaning of this revolutionary hymn,
sung by hordes of robbers who pass all over France, with which
our name is mixed up?” De Lisle himself, proscribed as a
Federalist, heard its re-echo upon his ears as a threat of death
as he fled among the paths of Jura. “What is this song
called?” he inquired of his guide. “The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</span></i>,” replied
the peasant. It was with difficulty that he escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Marseillaise” was the liquid fire of the revolution. It
distilled into the senses and the soul of the people the frenzy
of battle. Its notes floated like an ensign, dipped in warm
blood over a field of combat. Glory and crime, victory and
death, seemed interwoven in its strains. It was the song of
patriotism; but it was the signal of fury. It accompanied warriors
to the field and victims to the scaffold!</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no national air that will compare with the Marseillaise
in sublimity and power: it embraces the soft cadences full
of the peasant’s home, and the stormy clangor of silver and
steel when an empire is overthrown; it endears the memory
of the vine-dresser’s cottage, and makes the Frenchman, in his
exile, cry, “La belle France!” forgetful of the sword, and torch,
and guillotine, which have made his country a spectre of blood
in the eyes of nations. Nor can the foreigner listen to it, sung
by a company of exiles, or executed by a band of musicians,
without feeling that it is the pibroch of battle and war.</p>

      <div class='line'>The good the Rhine-song does to German hearts,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The origin of <cite>Yankee Doodle</cite> is by no means so clear as
American antiquaries desire. The statement that the air was
composed by Dr. Shackburg, in 1755, when the colonial troops
united with the British regulars near Albany, preparatory to
the attack on the French posts of Niagara and Frontenac, and
that it was produced in derision of the old-fashioned equipments
of the provincial soldiers as contrasted with the neat and orderly
appointments of the regulars, was published some years
ago in a musical magazine printed in Boston. The account
there given as to the origin of the song is this:—During the
attacks upon the French outposts in 1755, in America, Governor
Shirley and General Jackson led the force directed against the
enemy lying at Niagara and Frontenac. In the early part of
June, whilst these troops were stationed on the banks of the
Hudson, near Albany, the descendants of the “Pilgrim fathers”
flocked in from the Eastern provinces. Never was seen such a
motley regiment as took up its position on the left wing of
the British army. The band played music as antiquated and
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</span></i> as their <i>uniforms</i>; officers and privates had adopted regimentals
each man after his own fashion; one wore a flowing
wig, while his neighbor rejoiced in hair cropped closely to the
head; this one had a coat with wonderful long skirts, his fellow
marched without his upper garment; various as the colors
of the rainbow were the clothes worn by the gallant band. It
so happened that there was a certain Dr. Shackburg, wit, musician,
and surgeon, and one evening after mess he produced a
tune, which he earnestly commended, as a well-known piece of
military music, to the officers of the militia. The joke succeeded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>and Yankee Doodle was hailed by acclamation “their
own march.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This account is somewhat apocryphal, as there is no song:
the tune in the United States is a march; there are no words
to it of a national character. The only words ever affixed to
the air in this country is the following doggerel quatrain:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yankee Doodle came to town</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Upon a little pony;</div>
      <div class='line'>He stuck a feather in his hat</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And called it macaroni.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It has been asserted by English writers that the air and words
of these lines are as old as Cromwell’s time. The only alteration
is in making <i>Yankee Doodle</i> of what was <i>Nankee Doodle</i>.
It is asserted that the tune will be found in the <cite>Musical Antiquities
of England</cite>, and that <i>Nankee Doodle</i> was intended to
apply to Cromwell, and the other lines were designed to “allude
to his going into Oxford with a single plume, fastened in a knot
called a macaroni.” The tune was known in New England before
the Revolution as <cite>Lydia Fisher’s Jig</cite>, a name derived
from a famous lady of easy virtue in the reign of Charles II.,
and which has been perpetuated in the following nursery-rhyme:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lucy Locket lost her pocket,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Kitty Fisher found it;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not a bit of money in it,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Only binding round it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The regulars in Boston in 1775 and 1776 are said to have
sung verses to the same air:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yankee Doodle came to town,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For to buy a firelock;</div>
      <div class='line'>We will tar and feather him,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And so we will John Hancock, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which the tune came to be adopted by the
Americans, is shown in the following letter of the Rev. W. Gordon.
Describing the battles of Lexington and Concord, before
alluded to, he says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The brigade under Lord Percy marched out (of Boston)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>playing, by way of contempt, <cite>Yankee Doodle</cite>: they were afterwards
told that they had been made to dance to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is most likely that Yankee Doodle was originally derived
from Holland. A song with the following burden has long
been in use among the laborers who, in the time of harvest,
migrate from Germany to the Low Countries, where they receive
for their work as much buttermilk as they can drink, and
a tenth of the grain secured by their exertions:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yanker didel, doodel down,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Botermilk und Tanther.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That is, buttermilk and a tenth.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE AMERICAN FLAG.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A resolution was introduced in the American Congress, June
13, 1777, “That the flag of the thirteen United States be
thirteen stripes, alternately red and white; that the union be
thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation.”
There is a striking coincidence between the design
of our flag and the arms of General Washington, which consisted
of three stars in the upper portion, and three bars running
across the escutcheon. It is thought by some that the
flag was derived from this heraldic design. History informs us
that several flags were used by the Yankees before the present
national one was adopted. In March, 1775, a Union flag with
a red field was hoisted in New York, bearing the inscription on
one side of “George Rex and the liberties of America,” and
upon the reverse, “No Popery.” General Israel Putnam raised
on Prospect Hill, July 18, 1775, a flag bearing on one side
the motto of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui transtulit
sustinet</span></i>,” on the other, “An appeal to Heaven,”—an appeal
well taken and amply sustained. In October, 1775, the
floating batteries of Boston bore a flag with the latter motto,
and a pine-tree upon a white field, with the Massachusetts
emblem. Some of the colonies used in 1775 a flag with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>rattlesnake coiled as if about to strike, and the motto “Don’t
tread on me.” On January 18, 1776, the grand Union flag
of the stars and stripes was raised on the heights near Boston;
and it is said that some of the regulars made the great mistake
of supposing it was a token of submission to the king, whose
speech had just been sent to the Americans. The <cite>British Register</cite>
of 1776 says, “They [the rebels] burnt the king’s
speech, and changed their colors from a plain red ground to a
flag with thirteen stripes, as a symbol of the number and union
of the colonies.” A letter from Boston, published in the <cite>Pennsylvania
Gazette</cite>, in 1776, says, “The Union flag was raised
on the 2d, a compliment to the United Colonies.” These various
flags, the Pine-Tree, the Rattlesnake, and the Stripes, were
used, according to the tastes of the patriots, until July, 1777,
when the blue union of the stars was added to the stripes, and
the flag established by law. At first a stripe was added for
each new State; but the flag became too large, and Congress
reduced the stripes to the original thirteen, and now the stars
are made to correspond in number with the States. No one,
who lives under the protection of the Stars and Stripes, will
deny that “the American flag is one of the most beautiful
that floats upon any land or sea.” Its proportions are perfect
when it is properly made,—one-half as broad as it is long.
The first stripe at the top is red, the next white, and these
colors alternate, making the last stripe red. The blue field for
the stars is the width and square of the first seven stripes, viz.,
four red and three white. The colors of the American flag are
in beautiful relief, and it is altogether a splendid national emblem.
Long may it wave untarnished!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BROTHER JONATHAN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The origin of this term, as applied to the United States, is as
follows. When General Washington, after being appointed
commander of the army of the Revolutionary War, went to
Massachusetts to organize it, he found a great want of ammunition
and other means of defence; and on one occasion it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>seemed that no means could be devised for the necessary safety.
Jonathan Trumbull, the elder, was then Governor of the State
of Connecticut; and the general, placing the greatest reliance
on his excellency’s judgment, remarked, “We must consult
Brother Jonathan on the subject.” The general did so, and
the governor was successful in supplying many of the wants
of the army; and thenceforward, when difficulties arose, and the
army was spread over the country, it became a by-phrase, “We
must consult Brother Jonathan;” and the name has now become
a designation for the whole country, as John Bull has for
England.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>UNCLE SAM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Immediately after the declaration of war with England, in 1812,
Elbert Anderson, of New York, then a contractor, visited Troy,
where he purchased a large quantity of provisions. The inspectors
of the articles at that place were Ebenezer and Samuel
Wilson. The latter gentleman (universally known as “Uncle
Sam”) generally superintended in person a large number of
workmen, who, on this occasion, were employed in overhauling
the provisions purchased by the contractor. The casks were
marked “E. A.—U. S.” Their inspection fell to the lot of a
facetious fellow, who, on being asked the meaning of the mark,
said he did not know, unless it meant <i>Elbert Anderson</i> and
<i>Uncle Sam</i>, alluding to <i>Uncle Sam Wilson</i>. The joke took
among the workmen, and passed currently; and “Uncle Sam,”
when present, was often rallied by them on the increasing extent
of his possessions.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE DOLLAR MARK, $.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Writers are not agreed as to the derivation of this sign to
represent dollars. Some say that it comes from the letters U.
S., which, after the adoption of the Federal Constitution, were
prefixed to the Federal currency, and which afterwards, in the
hurry of writing, were run into one another, the U being made
first and the S over it. Others say that it is derived from the
contraction of the Spanish word <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</span></i>, dollars; others, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>Spanish <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">fuertes</span></i>, hard,—to distinguish silver from paper money.
The more plausible explanation is, that it is a modification of
the figure 8, and denotes a piece of eight reals, or, as the dollar
was formerly called, a <i>piece of eight</i>. It was then designated
by the figures <span class='fraction'>8<br /><span class='vincula'>8</span></span>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ORIGIN OF VARIOUS INVENTIONS AND CUSTOMS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Saxons first introduced archery in the time of Vortigern.
It was dropped immediately after the conquest, but was revived
by the Crusaders, they having felt the effects of it in their combats
with the Saracens, who probably derived it from the Parthians.
The Normans brought with them the cross-bow, but
after the time of Edward II. its use was supplanted by that of
the long-bow, which became the favorite national weapon. Bows
and arrows, as weapons of war, were in use with stone cannonballs
as late as 1640. All the statutes for the encouragement
of archery were framed after the invention of gunpowder and
firearms, the object being to prevent this ancient weapon becoming
obsolete. Yew-trees were encouraged in churchyards,
for the making of bows, in 1642. Hence their generality in
churchyards in England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coats of arms, or armorial bearings, came into vogue in the
reign of Richard I. of England, and became hereditary in
families about the year 1192. They took their rise from the
knights painting their banners with different figures to distinguish
them in the Crusades.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first standing army of modern times was established by
Charles VII. of France, in 1445. Previous to that time the
king had depended upon his nobles for contingents in time of
war. A standing army was first established in England in
1638, by Charles I., but it was declared illegal, as well as the
organization of the royal guards, in 1769. The first permanent
military band instituted in England was the yeomen of the
guards, established in 1486.</p>

<p class='c000'>Guns were invented by Swartz, a German, about 1378, and
brought into use by the Venetians, in 1382. Cannon were invented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>at an anterior date: at Amberg may still be seen a piece
of ordnance inscribed 1303. They were first used at the battle
of Cressy in 1346. In England, they were first used at the
siege of Berwick, in 1405. It was not until 1544, however,
that they were cast in England. They were employed on shipboard
by the Venetians in 1539, and were in use among the
Turks about the same time. An artillery company was instituted
in England for weekly military exercises in 1610.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dating from the Christian Era was commenced in Italy in
525, and in England in 816.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pliny gives the origin of glass-making thus. As some merchants
were carrying nitre, they stopped near a river issuing
from Mount Carmel. Not readily finding stones to rest their
kettles on, they used some pieces of nitre for that purpose: the
fire gradually dissolving the nitre, it mixed with the sand, and
a transparent matter flowed, which, in fact, was glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Insurance of ships was first practised in the reign of Cæsar,
in 45. It was a general custom in Europe in 1494. Insurance-offices
were first established in London in 1667.</p>

<p class='c000'>Astronomy was first studied by the Moors, and was introduced
by them into Europe in 1201. The rapid progress of
modern astronomy dates from the time of Copernicus. Books
of astronomy and geometry were destroyed, as infected with
magic, in England, under the reign of Edward VI., in 1552.</p>

<p class='c000'>Banks were first established by the Lombard Jews, in Italy.
The name is derived from <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">banco</span></i>, a term applied to the benches
erected in the market-places for the exchanges of money, &amp;c.
The first public bank was at Venice, in 1550. The Bank of
England was established in 1693. In 1696 its notes were at
twenty per cent. discount.</p>

<p class='c000'>The invention of bells is attributed to Paulinus, Bishop of
Nola, in Campania, about the year 400. They were originally introduced
into churches as a defence against thunder and lightning.
They were first hung up in England, at Croyland Abbey,
Lincolnshire, in 945. In the eleventh century and later, it
was the custom to baptize them in churches before they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>used. The curfew-bell was established in 1068. It was rung
at eight o’clock in the evening, when people were obliged to
put out their fire and candle. The custom was abolished in
1100. Chimes, or musical bells, were invented at Alost, in
Belgium, 1487. Bellmen were appointed in London, in 1556,
to ring the bells at night, and cry, “Take care of your fire and
candle, be charitable to the poor, and pray for the dead.”</p>

<p class='c000'>How many are aware of the origin of the word “boo!” used
to frighten children? It is a corruption of Boh, the name of
a fierce Gothic general, the son of Odin, the mention of whose
name spread a panic among his enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Book-keeping was first introduced into England from Italy
by Peele, in 1569. It was derived from a system of algebra
published by Burgo, at Venice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notaries public were first appointed by the Fathers of the
Christian Church to make a collection of the acts or memoirs
of martyrs in the first century.</p>

<p class='c000'>The administration of the oath in civil cases is of high antiquity.
See Exodus xxii. 11. Swearing on the Gospels was
first used in 528. The oath was first administered in judicial
proceedings in England by the Saxons, in 600. The words
“So help me God, and all saints,” concluded an oath, till
1550.</p>

<p class='c000'>Signals to be used at sea were first contrived by James II.,
when he was Duke of York, in 1665. They were afterwards
improved by the French commander Tourville, and by Admiral
Balchen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Raw silk is said to have first been made by a people of China
called Ceres, 150 <span class='fss'>B. C.</span> It was first brought from India, in 274,
and a pound of it at that time was worth a pound of gold. The
manufacture of raw silk was introduced into Europe from
India by some monks in 550. Silk dresses were first worn in
1455. The eggs of the silk-worm were first brought into
Europe in 527.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paulus Jovius was the first person who introduced mottoes;
Dorat, the first who brought anagrams into fashion. Rabelais
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>was the first who wrote satires in French prose; Etienne Jodelle,
the first who introduced tragedies into France. The Cardinal
of Ferrara, Archbishop of Lyons, was the first who had a tragicomedy
performed on the stage of Italian comedians. The first
sonnet that appeared in French is attributed to Jodelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Guido Aretino, a Benedictine monk of Arezzo, Tuscany, in
1204 designated the notes used in the musical scale by syllables
derived from the following verses of a Latin hymn dedicated to
St. John:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

</table>

<p class='c000'>By this means he converted the old tetrachord into hexachords.
He also invented lines and spaces in musical notation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The invention of clocks is by some ascribed to Pacificus,
Archdeacon of Verona, in the ninth century; and by others, to
Boethius, in the early part of the sixth. The Saracens are supposed
to have had clocks which were moved by weights, as
early as the eleventh century; and, as the term is applied by
Dante to a machine which struck the hours, clocks must have
been known in Italy about the end of the thirteenth or beginning
of the fourteenth century. The most ancient clock of
which we have any certain account was erected in a tower of
the palace of Charles V., King of France, in 1364, by Henry
de Wyck or de Vick, a German artist. A clock was erected
at Strasbourg in 1370, at Courtray about the same period, and
at Speyer in 1395.</p>

<p class='c000'>Watches are said to have been made at Nuremberg as early
as 1477; but it is uncertain how far the watches then constructed
resembled those now in use. Some of the early ones
were very small, in the shape of a pear, and sometimes fitted
into the top of a walking-stick. As time-keepers, watches
could have had very little value before the application of the
spiral spring as a regulator to the balance. This was invented
by Hooke, in 1658.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>The use of the pendulum was suggested by a circumstance
similar to that which started in Newton’s mind the train of
thought that led to the theory of gravitation. Galileo, when
under twenty years of age, standing one day in the metropolitan
church of Pisa, observed a lamp, which was suspended
from the ceiling, and which had been disturbed by
accident, swing backwards and forwards. This was a thing
so common that thousands, no doubt, had observed it before;
but Galileo, struck with the regularity with which it moved
backwards and forwards, reflected upon it, and perfected the
method now in use of measuring time by means of a pendulum.</p>

<p class='c000'>A monk named Rivalto mentions, in a sermon preached in
Florence in 1305, that spectacles had then been known about
twenty years. This would place the invention about the year
1285.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quills are supposed to have been used for writing-pens in the
fifth century, though the conjecture rests mainly on an anecdote
of Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, who, being so illiterate
that he could not write even the initials of his own name, was
provided with a plate of gold through which the letters were
cut, and, this being placed on the paper when his signature was
required, he traced the letters with a quill. The date of the
earliest certain account of the modern writing-pen is 636. The
next notice occurs in the latter part of the same century,
in a Latin sonnet to a pen by Aldhelm, a Saxon author. The
reeds formerly employed are still used in some Eastern nations.
Steel pens were first made by Wise, in England, in 1803.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first known treatise on stenography is the curious and
scarce little work entitled “Arte of Shorte, Swifte, and Secrete
Writing by Character, invented by Timothe Bright, Doctor of
Phisike.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The art of printing, according to Du Halde and the missionaries,
was practised in China nearly fifty years before the Christian
Era. In the time of Confucius, <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 500, books were
formed of slips of bamboo; and about 150 years after Christ,
paper was first made; <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 745, books were bound into leaves;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 900, printing was in general use. The process of printing
is simple. The materials consist of a graver, blocks of wood,
and a brush, which the printers carry with them from place
to place. Without wheel, or wedge, or screw, a printer will
throw off more than two thousand five hundred impressions in
one day. The paper (thin) can be bought for one-fourth the
price in China that it can in any other country. The works
of Confucius, six volumes, four hundred leaves, octavo, can be
bought for twelve cents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stamps for marking wares, packages, &amp;c. were in use among
the Roman tradesmen; and it is highly probable that had the
modern art of making paper been known to the ancients, they
would have diffused among themselves, and transmitted to posterity,
printed books.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the early commercial intercourse of the Venetians with
China, there is reason to believe that the knowledge of the art
and of its application to the multiplying of books was derived
from thence; for Venice is the first place in Europe, of which
we have any account, in which it was practised, a Government
decree respecting it having been issued October 11, 1441. Previous
to the year 1450, all printing had been executed by means
of engraved blocks of wood; but about this period, the great
and accumulating expense of engraving blocks for each separate
work led to the substitution of movable metal types. The
credit of this great improvement is given to Peter Schœffer, the
assistant and son-in-law of John Faust, of Mentz, (commonly
called Dr. Faustus.) The first book printed with the cast metal
types was the “Mentz Bible,” which was executed by Faust
and Guttemberg, between the years 1450 and 1455.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch claim to have originated stereotyping. They
have, as they say, a prayer-book stereotyped in 1701. The first
attempt at stereotyping in America was made in 1775, by Benjamin
Mecom, a printer of Philadelphia. He cast plates for a number
of pages of the New Testament, but never completed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first printing-press in America was established at Cambridge,
Mass., in 1639.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>COCK-FIGHTING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Themistocles, marching against the Persians, beheld two gamecocks
in the heat of battle, and thereupon pointed out to his
Athenian soldiery their indomitable courage. The Athenians
were victorious; and Themistocles gave order that an annual
cock-fight should be held in commemoration of the encounter
they had witnessed. No record of this sport occurs in England
before the year 1191.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TURNCOAT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The opprobious epithet, <i>turncoat</i>, took its rise from one of
the first dukes of Savoy, whose dominions lying open to the
incursions of the two contending houses of Spain and France,
he was obliged to temporize and fall in with that power that
was most likely to distress him, according to the success of their
arms against one another. So being frequently obliged to
change sides, he humorously got a coat made that was <i>blue</i> on one
side, and <i>white</i> on the other, and might be indifferently worn
either side out. While in the <i>Spanish</i> interest, he wore the
<i>blue</i> side out, and the <i>white</i> side was the badge for the <i>French</i>.
Hence he was called Emmanuel, surnamed the <i>Turncoat</i>, by
way of distinguishing him from other princes of the same
name of that house.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>INDIA-RUBBER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Caoutchouc was long known before its most valuable qualities
were appreciated. One of the earliest notices of its practical
use occurs in Dr. Priestly’s <cite>Theory and Practice of Perspective</cite>,
printed in 1770. “I have seen” says he, “a substance excellently
adapted to the purpose of wiping from paper the marks
of a black lead-pencil. It must, therefore, be of singular use
to those who practice drawing. It is sold by Mr. Nairne,
mathematical instrument-maker, opposite the Royal Exchange.
He sells a cubical piece, of about half an inch, for three shillings;
and, he says, it will last several years.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>FRICTION MATCHES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In 1836 the subject of friction matches attracted the attention
of Mr. L. C. Allin, of Springfield, Massachusetts. At that
time a clumsy phosphoric match, imported from France, had
come into limited use in the United States. It was made by
dipping the match-stick first into sulphur, and then into a
paste composed of chloride of potash, red lead, and loaf sugar.
Each box of matches was accompanied by a bottle of sulphuric
acid, into which every match had to be dipped in order to
light it. To abolish this inconvenience, and make a match
which would light from the friction caused by any rough surface,
was the task to which young Allin applied himself. He
succeeded, but took out no patent. On being urged to do so,
he found that a patent had already been obtained by one Phillips
of Chicopee, a peddler, who had probably picked up
through a third party the result of Mr. Allin’s study. Mr.
Allin’s legal adviser thought that he (Allin) would do better
to have the right to manufacture under Phillips’ patent (which
Phillips gave him without charge, in consideration of the
waiving of his claim,) than to bear the expense of the litigation
which was feared to be necessary to establish his claim. So the
inventor of friction matches became simply a manufacturer
under another man’s patent.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FLAG OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='c013'>On the 12th of April, 1606, the Union Jack—that famous
ensign—first made its appearance. From Rymer’s <cite>Fœdera</cite>, and
the Scottish Annals of Sir James Balfour, we learn that some
differences having arisen between ships of the two countries at sea,
the king ordained that a new flag be adopted with the crosses
of St. Andrew and St. George interlaced, by placing the latter
fimbriated on the blue flag of Scotland as the ground thereof.
This flag all ships were to carry at their main top; but English
ships were to display St. George’s red cross at their stern, and
the Scottish the white saltire of St. Andrew.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>BLUE-STOCKING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was the fashion in London, in 1781, for ladies to have
evening assemblies, where they might participate in conversation
with literary men. These societies acquired the name of
<i>Blue-Stocking</i> Clubs,—an appellation which has been applied
to pedantic females ever since. It arose from the custom of
Mr. Stillingfleet, one of the most eminent members, wearing
blue stockings. Such was the excellence of his conversation,
and his absence was so great a loss, that it used to be said,
“We can do nothing without the Blue Stockings;” and thus the
title was gradually established. In Hannah More’s poem, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bas
bleu</span></cite>, many of the most conspicuous members are mentioned.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SKEDADDLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This word may be easily traced to a Greek origin. The verb
<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">σκεδαννυμι</span>, of which the root is <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">σκεδα</span>, is used freely by Thucydides,
Herodotus, and other Greek writers, in describing the
dispersion of a routed army. From the root <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">σκεδα</span> the word
skedaddle is formed by simply adding the euphonious termination
<i>dle</i> and doubling the <i>d</i>, as required by the analogy of our
language in such words. In many words of undoubted Greek
extraction much greater changes are made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Swedes have a similar word, <i><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">skuddadahl</span></i>, and the Danes
another, <i><span lang="da" xml:lang="da">skyededehl</span></i>, both of which have the same signification.</p>

<p class='c000'>An old version of the Irish New Testament contains the
passage, “For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be <i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sgedad ol</span></i>.” This compound Irish
word <i><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">sgedad ol</span></i> (all scattered or utterly routed) was probably
used by some Irishman at Bull Run, and, being regarded as
felicitous, was at once adopted.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FOOLSCAP PAPER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The term of “foolscap,” to designate a certain size of paper,
no doubt has puzzled many an anxious inquirer. It appears
that Charles I., of England, granted numerous monopolies
for the support of the Government, among others the manufacture
of paper. The water-mark of the finest sort was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>royal arms of England. The consumption of this article was
great, and large fortunes were made by those who purchased
the exclusive right to vend it. This, among other monopolies,
was set aside by the Parliament that brought Charles I. to the
scaffold; and, by way of showing contempt for the King,
they ordered the royal arms to be taken from the paper, and a
fool with his cap and bells to be substituted. It is now over
two hundred years since the fool’s cap was taken from the
paper, but still the paper of the size which the Rump
Parliament ordered for their journals bears the name of the
water-mark placed there as an indignity to King Charles.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST FORGED BANK-NOTE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Sixty-four years after the establishment of the Bank of
England, the first forged note was presented for payment,
and to Richard William Vaughn, a Stafford linen-draper,
belongs the melancholy celebrity of having led the van in this
new phase of crime, in the year 1758. The records of his life
do not show want, beggary or starvation urging him, but a
simple desire to seem greater than he was. By one of the
artists employed (and there were several engaged on different
parts of the notes) the discovery was made. The criminal had
filled up to the number of twenty and deposited them in the
hands of a young lady to whom he was attached, as a proof of
his wealth. There is no calculating how much longer bank-notes
might have been free from imitation had this man not shown
with what ease they could be counterfeited. From this period
forged notes became common. His execution did not deter others
from the offence, and many a neck was forfeited to the halter
before the late abolition of capital punishment for that crime.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST PIANO-FORTE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A play-bill of the Covent Garden Theatre, dated May 16,
1767, after setting forth the performance of <cite>The Beggar’s
Opera</cite>, contains the following notification:—“End of Act
First, Miss Brickler will sing a favorite song from <cite>Judith</cite>,
accompanied by Mr. Dibdin on a new instrument called Piano-Forte.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>The first manufacturer is believed to be a German
named Backers, as there is still in existence the name-board
of a piano inscribed “Americus Backers, <cite>Factor et Inventor</cite>,
Jermyn Street, London, 1776.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST DOCTORS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The title of <span class='sc'>Doctor</span> was invented in the twelfth century,
at the first establishment of the universities. The first person
upon whom it was conferred was <span class='sc'>Irnerius</span>, a learned Professor
of <i>Law</i>, at the University of Bologna. He induced the
Emperor Lothaire II., whose Chancellor he was, to create the
title; and he himself was the first recipient of it. He was
made Doctor of Laws by that university. Subsequently the
title was borrowed by the faculty of Theology, and first conferred
by the University of Paris on <span class='sc'>Peter Lombard</span>, the
celebrated scholastic theologian. <span class='sc'>William Gordenio</span> was
the first person upon whom the title of Doctor of Medicine
was bestowed. He received it from the college at Asti, in
1329.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The first proclamation of Thanksgiving Day that is to be
found in a printed form is the one issued by his Excellency
<span class='sc'>Francis Bernard</span>, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief
in and over His Majesty’s province of the Massachusetts Bay,
in New England, and Vice-Admiral of the same, in 1767. It
is as follows:—</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>A Proclamation for a Public Thanksgiving.</span></h4>

<p class='c013'>As the Business of the Year is now drawing towards a Conclusion,
we are reminded, according to the laudable Usage of
this Province, to join together in a grateful Acknowledgement
of the manifold Mercies of the Divine Providence conferred
upon Us in the passing Year: Wherefore, I have thought fit
to appoint, and I do with the advice of His Majesty’s Council
appoint, Thursday, the Third Day of <i>December</i> next, to be a

  <h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST PRAYER IN CONGRESS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Thatcher’s <cite>Military Journal</cite>, under date of December,
1777, is a note containing the first prayer in Congress, made
by the Rev. Jacob Duché, rector of Christ Church, a gentleman
of learning and eloquence, who subsequently proved
traitorous to the cause of Independence:—</p>

<p class='c000'>O Lord our heavenly Father, high and mighty King of
kings and Lord of lords, who dost from thy throne behold all
the dwellers on earth, and reignest with power supreme and
uncontrolled over all the kingdoms, empires, and governments;
look down in mercy, we beseech thee, on these American
states, who have fled to thee from the rod of the oppressor,
and thrown themselves on thy gracious protection, desiring to
be henceforth dependent only on thee; to thee they have
appealed for the righteousness of their cause; to thee do they
now look up for that countenance and support which thou
alone canst give; take them, therefore, heavenly Father,
under thy nurturing care; give them wisdom in council, and
valor in the field; defeat the malicious designs of our cruel
adversaries; convince <i>them</i> of the unrighteousness of their
cause; and if they still persist in their sanguinary purposes,
O let the voice of thine own unerring justice, sounding in
their hearts, constrain them to drop the weapons of war from
their unnerved hands in the day of battle. Be thou present,
O God of Wisdom, and direct the counsels of this honorable
assembly; enable them to settle things on the best and surest
foundation, that the scene of blood may be speedily closed,
that order, harmony, and peace may be effectually restored,
and truth and justice, religion and piety, prevail and flourish
amongst thy people. Preserve the health of their bodies and
the vigor of their minds; shower down on <i>them</i> and the <i>millions</i>
they here represent, such temporal blessings as thou
seest expedient for them in this world, and crown them with
everlasting glory in the world to come. All this we ask in the
name and through the merits of Jesus Christ, thy Son, our
Saviour. Amen!</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST REPORTERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In Sylvester O’Halloran’s <cite>History and Antiquities of Ireland</cite>,
published in Dublin in 1772, is the curious entry subjoined.
Bille, a Milesian king of a portion of Spain, had a son named
Gollamh, who “solicited his father’s permission to assist their
Phœnician ancestors, then greatly distressed by continual wars,”
and having gained his consent, the passage describing the result
proceeds thus:—</p>

<p class='c000'>With a well-appointed fleet of thirty ships and a select number
of intrepid warriors, he weighed anchor from the harbor of
Corunna for Syria. It appears that war was not the sole business
of this equipment; for in this fleet were embarked twelve
youths of uncommon learning and abilities, who were directed
to make remarks on whatever they found new, either in astronomy,
navigation, arts, sciences, or manufactures. They
were to communicate their remarks and discoveries to each
other, and keep an exact account of whatever was worthy of
notice. This took place in the year of the world, 2650.</p>

<p class='c000'>These twelve youths were <i>reporters</i>, and if this story be true,
the profession constituting “the fourth estate” may boast of an
ancient lineage.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST EPIGRAM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among “first things,” the following is worth preserving, as it
is believed to be the first epigram extant in the English language.
It was written by Sir Thomas Wyat, who in some of
his sonnets did not hesitate to intimate his secret passion for
Anne Boleyn.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Of a new married student that plaid fast or lose.</i></h3>

  <h3 class='c012'>NEWS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The word news is commonly supposed to be derived from the
adjective <i>new</i>. It is asserted, however, that its origin is traceable
to a custom in former times of placing on the newspapers
of the day the initial letters of the cardinal points of the compass,
thus:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>N</div>
    <div>│</div>
    <div>│</div>
    <div>W──────┼──────E</div>
    <div>│</div>
    <div>│</div>
    <div>S</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These letters were intended to indicate that the paper contained
intelligence from the four quarters of the globe, but they finally
came to assume the form of the word <i>news</i>, from which the
term newspaper is derived.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE EARLIEST NEWSPAPERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Englishe Mercurie, now in MS. in the British Museum,
has been proved to be a forgery. The oldest regular newspaper
published in England was established by Nathaniel Butter, in
1662.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest paper in France was commenced by Theophrastus
Renaudet, in 1632, during the reign of Louis XIII. It was
called the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gazette de France</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Dutch newspaper, which is still continued under
the name of the <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Haarlem Courant</span></cite>, is dated January 8, 1656.
It was then called <cite><span lang="lb" xml:lang="lb">De Weeckelycke Courante van Europa</span></cite>, and
contained two small folio pages of news.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Russian newspaper was published in 1703. Peter
the Great not only took part personally in its editorial composition,
but in correcting proofs, as appears from sheets still in
existence in which are marks and alterations in his own
hand. There are two complete copies of the first year’s edition
of this paper in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first newspaper established in North America was the
Boston News-Letter, commenced April 24, 1704. It was half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>a sheet of paper, twelve inches by eight, two columns on a
page. B. Green was the printer. It survived till 1776,—seventy-two
years. It advocated the policy of the British
Government at the commencement of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>From a copy of this paper printed in 1769 is obtained the
following announcement:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bell-cart will go through Boston, before the end of next
month, to collect rags for the paper-mill at Milton, when all
people that will encourage the paper-manufactory may dispose
of their rags:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rags are as beauties, which concealéd lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>But when in paper, how it charms the eye!</div>
      <div class='line'>Pray save your rags, new beauties it discover;</div>
      <div class='line'>For paper truly, every one’s a lover:</div>
      <div class='line'>By the pen and press such knowledge is displayed</div>
      <div class='line'>As wouldn’t exist if paper was not made.</div>
      <div class='line'>Wisdom of things mysterious, divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Illustriously doth on paper shine.”</div>
    </div>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST PRINTING BY STEAM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The first printing by steam was executed in the year 1817,
by Bensley &amp; Son, London. The first book thus printed was
Dr. Elliotson’s second edition of Blumenbach’s Physiology.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Professor Morse, having returned to his native land from
Europe, proceeded immediately to Washington, where he renewed
his endeavors to procure the passage of the bill granting
the appropriation of thirty thousand dollars. Towards the
close of the session of 1844, the House of Representatives took
it up and passed it by a large majority, and it only remained
for the action of the Senate. Its progress through this house,
as might be supposed, was watched with the most intense anxiety
by Professor Morse. There were only two days before the
close of the session, and it was found, on examination of the
calendar, that no less than one hundred and forty-three bills
had precedence to it. Professor Morse had nearly reached the
bottom of his purse; his hard-earned savings were almost spent;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>and, although he had struggled on with undying hope for many
years, it is hardly to be wondered at that he felt disheartened
now. On the last night of the session he remained till nine
o’clock, and then left without the slightest hope that the bill
would be passed. He returned to his hotel, counted his money,
and found that after paying his expenses to New York he
would have seventy-five cents left. That night he went to bed
sad, but not without hope for the future; for, through all his
difficulties and trials, that never forsook him. The next morning,
as he was going to breakfast, one of the waiters informed
him that a young lady was in the parlor waiting to see him.
He went in immediately, and found that the young lady was
Miss Ellsworth, daughter of the Commissioner of Patents, who
had been his most steadfast friend while in Washington.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I come,” said she, “to congratulate you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For what?” said Professor Morse.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the passage of your bill,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, no: you must be mistaken,” said he. “I remained in
the Senate till a late hour last night, and there was no prospect
of its being reached.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Am I the first, then,” she exclaimed, joyfully, “to tell
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, if it is really so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” she continued, “father remained till the adjournment,
and heard it passed; and I asked him if I might not run
over and tell you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Annie,” said the Professor, his emotion almost choking his
utterance, “the first message that is sent from Washington to
Baltimore shall be sent from you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” she replied, “I will keep you to your word.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While the line was in process of completion, Prof. Morse was in
New York, and upon receiving intelligence that it was in working
order, he wrote to those in charge, telling them not to
transmit any messages over it till his arrival. He then set out
immediately for Washington, and on reaching that city sent a
note to Miss Ellsworth, informing her that he was now ready
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>to fulfill his promise, and asking her what message he should
send.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this he received the following reply:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>What hath God wrought!</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Words that ought to be written in characters of living light.
The message was twice repeated, and each time with the greatest
success. As soon as the result of the experiment was made
known, Governor Seymour, of Connecticut, afterwards United
States minister at St. Petersburg, called upon Professor Morse
and claimed the first message for his State, on the ground that
Miss Ellsworth was a native of Hartford. We need scarcely
add that his claim was admitted; and now, engraved in letters
of gold, it is displayed conspicuously in the archives of the
Historical Society of Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Prolusiones Academicæ of Famianus Strada</cite>, first
printed in 1617, consist of a series of essays upon Oratory,
Philosophy, and Poetry, with some admirable imitations of
sundry Roman authors, in the style of <cite>Father Prout’s
Reliques</cite>. In the imitation of Lucretius, ii. 6, is a description
of the loadstone and its power of communicating intelligence,
remarkable as foreshadowing the modern method of
telegraphic communication. The following is a literal translation
of the curious passage:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>The Loadstone is a wonderful sort of mineral. Any articles
made of iron, like needles, if touched by it, derive by contact
not only peculiar power, but a certain property of motion by
which they turn ever towards the Constellation of the Bear,
near the North Pole. By some peculiar correspondency of impulse,
any number of needles, which may have touched the
loadstone, preserve at all times a precisely corresponding position
and motion. Thus it happens that if one needle be moved
at Rome, any other, however far apart, is bound by some secret
natural condition to follow the same motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you desire, therefore, to communicate intelligence to a
distant friend, who cannot be reached by letter, take a plain,
round, flat disc, and upon its outer rim mark down the letters
of the alphabet, A, B, C, &amp;c., and, traversing upon the middle
of your disc, have a needle (which has touched loadstone) so
arranged that it may be made to touch upon any particular letter
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>. Make a similar disc, the exact duplicate of
this first one, with corresponding letters on its margin, and
with a revolving magnetized needle. Let the friend you propose
corresponding with take, at his departure, one disc along
with him, and let him agree with you beforehand on what
particular days and at what particular hours he will take observation
of the needle, to see if it be vibrating and to learn what
it marks on the index. With this arrangement understood between
you both, if you wish to hold a private conversation
with this friend, whom the shores of some distant land have
separated from you, turn your finger to the disc and touch the
easy-moving needle. Before you lie, marked upon the outer
edge, all the various letters: direct the needle to such letters
as are necessary to form the words you want, touching a little
letter here and there with the needle’s point, as it goes traversing
round and round the board, until you throw together, one
by one, your various ideas. Lo! the wonderful fidelity of correspondence!
Your distant friend notes the revolving needle
vibrate without apparent impulse and fly hither and thither
round the rim. He notes its movements, and reading, as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>follows its motion, the various letters which make up the words,
he perceives all that is necessary, and learns your meaning from
the interpreting needle. When he sees the needle pause, he,
in turn, in like manner touches the various letters, and
sends back his answer to his friend. Oh that this style of
writing were brought into use, that a friendly message might
travel quicker and safer, defying snares of robbers or delaying
rivers! Would that the prince himself would finish the great
work with his own hands! Then we race of scribblers, emerging
from our sea of ink, would lay the quill an offering on the
altars of the loadstone.</p>

<p class='c000'>This idea of Strada is based upon the erroneous impression
entertained generally at the time when he wrote, that magnetic
power, when imparted by the loadstone to metallic articles like
needles, communicated to them a kind of homogeneous impulse,
which of necessity caused between them a sympathetic correspondence
of motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The curious reader will be further interested to learn from
the following passage, extracted from the “Tour” of <span class='sc'>Arthur
Young</span>, the distinguished agriculturist, who travelled through
Ireland in 1775–78, that the theory of electrical correspondence
by means of a wire was <i>practically</i> illustrated before Mr. Morse
was born:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In electricity, Mons. Losmond has made a remarkable discovery.
You write two or three words on a paper; he takes it
with him into a room, and turns a machine enclosed in a cylindrical
case, at the top of which is an electrometer, in the shape
of a small fine pith ball. A wire connects with a similar cylinder
and electrometer in a distant apartment, and his wife, by remarking
the corresponding motions of the ball, writes down the words
they indicate, <i>from which it appears that he has formed an
alphabet of motions. As the length of wire makes no difference
in the effect, a correspondence might be carried on at any distance</i>,
within and without a besieged town, for instance, or
for a purpose much more worthy and a thousand times more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>harmless, between two lovers, prohibited or prevented from any
better epistolary intercourse.</p>

<p class='c000'>A second edition of Mr. Young’s Tour was published in
quarto in 1794, and the above extract may be found on page
79, volume i.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST DISCOVERIES OF STEAM-POWER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following extracts from an address by Edward Everett,
at an agricultural fair, embody facts the more interesting from
their limited notoriety:—</p>

<p class='c000'>I never contemplate the history of navigation of the ocean
by steam, but it seems to illustrate to me in the most striking
manner the slow steps by which a great movement advances
for generations, for ages, from the first germ,—then, when
the hour is come, the rapidity with which it rushes to a final
consummation. Providence offered this great problem of navigating
the ocean by steam to every civilized nation almost on
the globe. As long ago as the year 1543, there was a captain
in Spain, who constructed a vessel of two hundred tons, and
propelled it, at Barcelona, in the presence of the Emperor
Charles V. and his court, by an engine, the construction of
which he kept a secret. But old documents tell us it was a
monster caldron boiler of water, and that there were two movable
wheels on the outside of the vessel. The Emperor was
satisfied with its operation, but the treasurer of the kingdom interposed
objections to its introduction. The engine itself seems
to have sprung to a point of perfection hardly surpassed at
the present day, but no encouragement was given to the enterprise.
Spain was not ripe for it; the age was not ripe for it;
and the poor inventor, whose name was Blasco de Guerere,
wearied and disgusted at the want of patronage, took the engine
out of the vessel and allowed the ship to rot in the arsenal,
and the secret of his machine was buried in his grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was in 1543. A century passed away, and Providence
offered the same problem to be solved by France. In reference
to this, we have an extraordinary account, and from a source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>equally extraordinary,—from the writings of a celebrated female,
in the middle of that century, equally renowned for her beauty,
for her immoralities, and for her longevity,—for she lived to be
one hundred and thirty-four years of age,—the famous Marian de
l’Orme. There is a letter from this lady, written to one of her
admirers in 1641, containing an account of a visit she made to a
mad-house in Paris in company with the Marquis of Worcester.
She goes on to relate, that in company with the marquis, while
crossing the courtyard of that dismal establishment, almost petrified
with terror, and clinging to her companion, she saw a
frightful face through the bars of the building, and heard this
voice:—“I am not mad—I am not mad: I have made a discovery
which will enrich the kingdom that shall adopt it.” She
asked the guide what it meant: he shrugged his shoulders and
said, laughingly, “Not much; something about the powers of
steam.” Upon this, the lady laughed also, to think that a man
should go mad on such a frivolous subject. The guide went
on to say that the man’s name was Solomon de Coste; that
he came from Normandy four years before, and exhibited to
the king an invention by which, by the power of steam,
you could move a carriage, navigate the ocean: “in short,
if you believed him,” said the guide, “there was nothing
you could not do by the power of steam.” Cardinal Richelieu,
who at that time was France itself, and who wielded the whole
power of government,—and, in truth, an enlightened man, as
worldly wisdom goes,—was appealed to by Solomon de Coste.
De Coste was a persevering man, and he followed Cardinal
Richelieu from place to place, exhibiting his invention, until
the cardinal, getting tired of his importunities, sent him to the
mad-house. The guide stated further that he had written a
book entitled <cite>Motive Power</cite>, and handed the visitors a copy of
it. The Marquis of Worcester, who was an inventor, was much
interested in the book, and incorporated a considerable portion
of it in his well-known work called <cite>The Century of Invention</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen from this anecdote how France proved in
1641, as Spain had proved in 1543, that she was unable to take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>up and wield this mortal thunderbolt. And so the problem of
navigating the ocean by steam was reserved for the Anglo-Saxon
race. Soon after this period, the best mechanical skill of England
was directed towards this invention. Experiments were
often made, with no success, and sometimes with only partial
success, until the middle of the last century, when the seeds
implanted in the minds of ingenious men for two hundred
years germinated, and the steam-engine—that scarcely inanimate
Titan, that living, burning mechanism—was brought
nearly to a state of perfection by James Watt, who took out a
patent in 1769,—the great year in which Wellington and Napoleon
were born; and ages after the names of Austerlitz and
Waterloo shall perish from the memory of man, the myriad
hosts of intelligent labor, marshalled by the fiery champions
that James Watt has placed in the field, shall gain their bloodless
triumph, not for the destruction but for the service of mankind.
All hail, then, to the mute, indefatigable giant, in the
depths of the darksome mines, along the pathway of travel and
trade, and on the mountain wave, that is destined to drag, urge,
heave, haul, for the service of man! No fatigue shall palsy its
herculean arm, no trampled hosts shall writhe beneath its iron
feet, no widow’s heart shall bleed at its beneficent victories.
England invented the steam-engine; but it seems as if by the
will of Providence she could not go farther. Queen of the
seas, as she deemed herself, she could not apply the invention
she had brought almost to perfection, and that part of the great
problem, the navigation of the ocean by steam, was reserved for
the other branch of the Anglo-Saxon race,—the branch situated
in a region in this Western hemisphere whose territory is traversed
by some of the noblest rivers that belt the surface of the
globe, and separated by the world-wide ocean from the Eastern
hemisphere. It is amazing to consider how, with the dawn of
the Revolution, the thoughts of men turned to the application
of steam-navigation. Rumsey, Fitch, and Evans made experiments,
and those experiments attracted the notice of one whom
nothing escaped pertaining to the welfare of his country: I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>mean Washington. And we have a certificate from him, expressing
the satisfaction with which he had witnessed the experiment
of Rumsey. The attempt proved rather unsuccessful.
I think it a providential appointment that the ocean was not
navigated by steam in the Revolutionary age. The enormous
preponderance of British capital and skill, if the ocean had
been navigated by steam, would have put in her possession facilities
for blockading our ports and transporting armies to our
coasts, which might have had a disastrous effect on the result
of the whole contest. But the Revolution passed and independence
was established: the hour had come, and the man
was there.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1799 this system of steam-navigation became
matured in the mind of Fulton, who found a liberal and active
coadjutor in Chancellor Livingston, who, in the same year,
applied to the Legislature of New York for an act of incorporation.
I am sorry to say that America at that moment could not
boast of much keener perception of the nature of this discovery
than France or Spain had done before. Chancellor Livingston
at last had a petition drawn up of the act he desired passed. It
was drafted by the young men of the Legislature, who, when
tired of the graver matters of law, used to call up the “steam
bill” that they might have a little fun. Young America, on that
occasion, did not show himself much wiser than his senior.
Nothing daunted at the coldness he received, nothing discouraged
by the partial success of the first experiment, Chancellor
Livingston persevered. Twenty years elapsed before
steamers were found upon our lakes and rivers, and at that time
such a system of steam-navigation was wholly unknown, except
by hearsay, in Europe. This application of steam soon became
a pressing necessity in this country, but twenty years more
passed away before it was adopted in England. I could not
but think, when the news of the Atlantic Telegraph came,
what must have been the emotions of Fulton and Franklin
could they have stood upon the quarter-deck of the Niagara
and witnessed the successful termination of that electric communication
which is the result of their united discoveries!</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>ÆRIAL NAVIGATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>When air-balloons were first discovered, some one flippantly
asked Dr. Franklin what was the use of it. The philosopher
answered the question by asking another:—“What is the use
of a new-born infant? It may become a man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The first balloon-ascension was made by Pilatre de Rozier
and the Marquis d’Arlandes, November 21, 1783, in a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">montgolfière</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A century and a half before this, John Gregorie wrote,
“The air itself is not so unlike to water, but that it may be
demonstrated to be navigable, and that a ship may sail upon
the convexity thereof by the same reasons that it is carried
upon the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first number of the Philosophical Collections, 1679, is
“a demonstration how it is practically possible to make a ship,
which shall be sustained by the air, and may be moved either
by sails or oars,” from a work entitled <cite>Prodroma</cite>, published in
Italian by P. Francesco Lana. The scheme was that of making
a brazen vessel which should weigh less than the air it contained,
and consequently float in the air when that which was
within it was pumped out. He calculated every thing—except
the pressure of the atmosphere, in consequence of which <i>slight</i>
oversight he realized no practical result.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood in 1619; but
we learn from a passage in Longinus (ch. xxii.) that the fact
was known two thousand years before. The father of critics,
to exemplify and illustrate the use and value of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">trope</span></i> in writing,
has garbled from the <cite>Timæus</cite> of Plato a number of sentences
descriptive of the anatomy of the human body, where the circulation
of the blood is pointed at in terms singularly graphic.
The exact extent of professional knowledge attained in the
time of the great philosopher is by no means clearly defined.
He speaks of the fact, however, not with a view to prove what
was contested or chimerical, but avails himself of it to figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>the surpassing wisdom of the gods in constructing the human
frame.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ANÆSTHESIA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The use of the vapor of sulphuric ether for the purpose of
inducing insensibility to surgical operations was first practically
adopted by Dr. Morton, of Boston, in 1846; that of chloroform,
by Dr. Simpson, of Edinburgh, in 1847. To this period
we must assign the most important epoch in the annals of surgery,
and the date of one of the grandest discoveries of
science and one of the greatest blessings ever conferred upon
humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The idea, however, of saving the human body, by artificial
means, from the pains and tortures inflicted by the knife
of the surgeon, has been by no means either first broached or
first acted upon in recent times. Intense pain is regarded by
mankind generally as so serious an evil that it would have been
strange indeed if efforts had not been early made to diminish this
species of suffering. The use of the juice of the poppy, henbane,
mandragora, and other narcotic preparations, to effect
this object by their deadening influence, may be traced back
till it disappears in the darkness of a remote antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intoxicating vapors were also employed, by way of inhalation,
to produce the same effects as drugs of this nature introduced
into the stomach. This appears from the account given by
Herodotus of the practice of the Scythians, several centuries
before Christ, of using the vapor of hemp-seed as a means of
drunkenness. The known means of stupefaction were very
early resorted to in order to counteract pain produced by artificial
causes. In executions under the horrible form of crucifixion,
soporific mixtures were administered to alleviate the
pangs of the victim. The draught of vinegar and gall, or
myrrh, offered to the Saviour in his agony, was the ordinary
tribute of human sympathy extorted from the bystander by
the spectacle of intolerable anguish.</p>

<p class='c000'>That some lethean anodyne might be found to assuage the
torment of surgical operations as they were anciently performed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>[cauterizing the cut surfaces, instead of tying the arteries,] was
not only a favorite notion, but it had been in some degree, however
imperfect, reduced to practice. Pliny the Naturalist, who
perished in the eruption of Vesuvius which entombed the city
of Herculaneum in the year 79, bears distinct and decided
testimony to this fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his description of the plant known as the mandragora or
circeius, he says, “It has a soporific power on the faculties of
those who drink it. The ordinary potion is half a cup. It is
drunk against serpents, and <i>before cuttings and puncturings</i>,
lest they should be felt.” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibitur et contra serpentes, et ante
sectiones, punctionesque, ne sentiantur.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c000'>When he comes to speak of the plant <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eruca</span></i>, called by us the
rocket, he informs us that its seeds, when drunk, infused in
wine, by criminals about to undergo the lash, produce a certain
callousness or induration of feeling (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">duaitiam, quandam contra
sensum induere</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Pliny also asserts that the stone <i>Memphitis</i>, powdered and
applied in a liniment with vinegar, will stupefy parts to be cut
or cauterized, “for it so paralyzes the part that it feels no
pain” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nec sentit cruciatum</span></i>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Dioscorides, a Greek physician of Cilicia, in Asia, who was
born about the time of Pliny’s death, and who wrote an extensive
work on the materia medica, observes, in his chapter on
mandragora,—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. “Some boil down the roots in wine to a third part, and
preserve the juice thus procured, and give one <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cyathus</span> of it in
sleeplessness and severe pains, of whatever part; also <i>to cause
the insensibility</i>—to produce the anæsthesia <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ποιειν αναισθησιαν</span>—<i>of
those who are to be cut or cauterized</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>2. “There is prepared, also, besides the decoction, a wine
from the bark of the root, three minæ being thrown into a
cask of sweet wine, and of this three <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cyathi</span> are given <i>to those
who are to be cut or cauterized, as aforesaid</i>; for, being thrown
into a deep sleep, <i>they do not perceive pain</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Speaking of another variety of mandragora, called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morion</span></i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>he observes, “Medical men use it also for those who are to be
cut or cauterized.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dioscorides also describes the stone Memphitis, mentioned by
Pliny, and says that when it is powdered and applied to parts
to be cut or cauterized, they are rendered, <i>without the slightest
danger</i>, wholly insensible to pain. Matthiolus, the commentator
on Dioscorides, confirms his statement of the virtues of
mandragora, which is repeated by Dodoneus. “Wine in which
the roots of mandragora have been steeped,” says this latter
writer, “brings on sleep, and appeases all pains, so that it is
given to those who are to be cut, sawed, or burned in any
parts of their body, that they may not perceive pain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The expressions used by Apuleius of Madaura, who flourished
about a century after Pliny, are still more remarkable
than those already quoted from the older authors. He says,
when treating of mandragora, “If any one is to have a member
mutilated, burned, or sawed, [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutilandum, comburendum,
vel serrandum</span></i>,] let him drink half an ounce with wine, and
<i>let him sleep till the member is cut away without any pain or
sensation</i> [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et tantum dormiet, quosque abscindatur membrum
aliquo sine dolore et sensu</span></i>].”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not in Europe and in Western Asia alone that these
early efforts to discover some lethean were made, and attended
with partial success. On the opposite side of the continent,
the Chinese—who have anticipated the Europeans in so many
important inventions, as in gunpowder, the mariner’s compass,
printing, lithography, paper money, and the use of coal—seem
to have been quite as far in advance of the Occidental world in
medical science. They understood, ages before they were introduced
into Christendom, the use of substances containing
iodine for the cure of the goitre, and employed spurred rye
(ergot) to shorten dangerously-prolonged labor in difficult accouchements.
Among the therapeutic methods confirmed by
the experience of thousands of years, the records of which they
have preserved with religious veneration, the employment of an
anæsthetic agent to paralyze the nervous sensibility before performing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>surgical operations, is distinctly set forth. Among a
considerable number of Chinese works on the pharmacopœia,
medicine, and surgery, in the National Library at Paris, is one
entitled <cite><span lang="zh-Latn" xml:lang="zh-Latn">Kou-kin-i-tong</span></cite>, or general collection of ancient and
modern medicine, in fifty volumes quarto. Several hundred
biographical notices of the most distinguished physicians in
China are prefixed to this work. The following curious passages
occur in the sketches of the biography of <i><span lang="zh-Latn" xml:lang="zh-Latn">Hoa-tho</span></i>, who
flourished under the dynasty of <i><span lang="zh-Latn" xml:lang="zh-Latn">Wei</span></i>, between the years 220
and 230 of our era. “When he determined that it was necessary
to employ acupuncture, he employed it in two or three
places; and so with the <i><span lang="zh-Latn" xml:lang="zh-Latn">moxa</span></i> if that was indicated by the
nature of the affection to be treated. But if the disease resided
in parts upon which the needle, moxa, or liquid medicaments
could not operate,—for example in the bones, or the marrow
of the bones, in the stomach or the intestines,—<i>he gave</i> the
patient a preparation of hemp, (in the Chinese language <i><span lang="zh-Latn" xml:lang="zh-Latn">mayo</span></i>,)
and after a few moments he became as insensible as if he had
been drunk or dead. Then, as the case required, he performed
operations, incisions, or amputations, and removed the cause of
the malady; then he brought together and secured the tissues,
and applied liniments. After a certain number of days, the
patient recovered, <i>without having experienced the slightest pain
during the operation</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost a thousand years after the date of the unmistakable
phrases quoted from Apuleius, according to the testimony of
William of Tyre, and other chroniclers of the wars for the
rescue of the holy sepulchre, and the fascinating narrative of
<cite>Marco Polo</cite>, a state of anæsthesia was induced for very different
purposes. It became an instrument in the hands of bold and
crafty impostors to perpetuate and extend the most terrible
fanaticism that the world has ever seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The employment of anæsthetic agents in surgical operations
was not forgotten or abandoned during the period when they
were pressed into the appalling service just described. In the
thirteenth century, anæsthesia was produced by inhalation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>an anodyne vapor, in a mode oddly forestalling the practices
of the present day, which is described as follows in the surgical
treatise of Theodoric, who died in 1298. It is the receipt for
the “spongia somnifera,” as it is called in the rubric:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The preparation of a scent for performing surgical operations,
according to Master Hugo. It is made thus:—Take of
opium and the juice of unripe mulberry, of hyoscyamus, of the
juice of the hemlock, of the juice of the leaves of the mandragora,
of the juice of the woody ivy, of the juice of the forest
mulberry, of the seeds of lettuce, of the seed of the burdock,
which has large and round apples, and of the water-hemlock,
each one ounce; mix the whole of these together in a brazen
vessel, and then place a new sponge in it, and let the whole
boil, and as long as the sun on the dog-days, till it (the sponge)
consumes it all, and let it be boiled away in it. As often as
there is need of it, place this same sponge in warm water for one
hour, and let it be applied to the nostrils till he who is to be
operated on (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui incidentus est</span></i>) has fallen asleep; and in this
state let the operation be performed (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et sic fiat chirurgia</span></i>).
When this is finished, in order to rouse him, place another,
dipped in vinegar, frequently to his nose, or let the juice of the
roots of fenigreek be squirted into his nostrils. Presently he
awakens.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Subsequent to Theodoric’s time, we find many interesting
and suggestive observations in the writings of Baptista Porta,
Chamappe, Meissner, Dauriol, Haller, and Blandin. About
half a century ago, Sir Humphry Davy thus hinted at the
possibility that a pain subduing gas might be inhaled:—“As
<i>nitrous oxide</i>, in its extensive operation, appears capable of
destroying physical pain, it may probably be used with advantage
during surgical operations in which no great effusion of
blood takes place.” Baron Larrey, Napoleon’s surgeon, after
the battle of Eylau, found a remarkable insensibility in the
wounded who suffered amputations, owing to the intense cold.
This fact afterwards led to the application of ice as a local anæsthetic.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>The former general belief that a degree of anæsthetic and
prolonged sleep could be induced artificially by certain medicated
potions and preparations is also shown by the frequency
with which the idea is alluded to by the older poets and storytellers,
and made part of the machinery in the popular romance
and drama. In the history of Taliesin, (one of the antique
Welsh tales contained in the Mabinogion,) Rhun is described as
having put the maid of the wife of Elphin into a deep sleep
with a powder put into her drink, and as having cut off one of
her fingers when she was in this case of artificial anæsthesia.
Shakspeare, besides alluding more than once to the soporific property
of mandragora, describes with graphic power in Romeo
and Juliet, and in Cymbeline, the imagined effects of subtle
distilled potions supposed capable of inducing, without danger,
a prolonged state of death-like sleep or lethargy. And Thomas
Middleton, in his tragedy of <cite>Women beware Women</cite>, published
in 1657, pointedly and directly alludes in the following lines, to
the practice of anæsthesia in ancient surgery:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'><i>Hippolito</i>. Yes, my lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>I make no doubt, as I shall take the course,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which she shall never know till it be acted;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when she wakes to honor, then she’ll thank me for’t.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>I’ll imitate the pities of old surgeons</i></div>
      <div class='line'>To this lost limb; <i>who, ere they show their art,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Cast one asleep, then cut the diseased part</i>;</div>
      <div class='line'>So out of love to her I pity most,</div>
      <div class='line'>She shall not feel him going till he’s lost;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then she’ll commend the cure.—Act iv. Sc. 1.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The following curious lines from Du Bartas, translated by
Joshua Sylvester (?) are also well worth transcribing in this
connection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Du Bartas died about the year 1590:—</p>

      <div class='line'>And thereof made the Mother of Mankind.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The history of anæsthetics is a remarkable illustration of the
acknowledged fact that science has sometimes, for a long season,
altogether lost sight of great practical thoughts, from being
unprovided with proper means and instruments for carrying out
those thoughts into practical execution; and hence it ever and
anon occurs that a supposed modern discovery is only the rediscovery
of a principle already sufficiently known to other
ages, or to remote nations.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE BOOMERANG.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following paragraph in Pliny’s <cite>Natural History</cite>, xxiv. 72,
apparently refers to the Boomerang, with which, according to
recent discoveries, the early people of the East were acquainted.
See Bonomi’s <cite>Nineveh</cite>, p. 136. Pliny, speaking of the account
given by Pythagoras of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquifolia</span></i>, either the holm-oak or
the holly, says:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Baculum ex eâ factum, in quodvis animal emissum, etiamsi citra
ceciderit defectu mittentis, ipsum per sese cubitu proprius adlabi; tam
præcipuam naturam inesse arbori.</span></p>

<p class='c018'>(If a staff made of this wood, when thrown at any animal, from want
of strength in the party throwing it, happens to fall short of the mark, it
will fall back again towards the thrower of its own accord—so remarkable
are the properties of this tree.)</p>

<p class='c000'>The readings of the passage vary, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubitu</span></i> being given in some
MSS. for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">recubitu</span></i>. Pythagoras probably heard of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">baculum</span></i>
during his travels eastward, and being unable to understand how
its formation could endow it with the singular property referred
to, was induced to believe that this peculiarity was owing to
the nature of the tree.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>TABLE-MOVING AND ALPHABET-RAPPING IN THE FOURTH CENTURY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The following remarkable narration is the confession of a
conspirator named Hilarius, who was accused of resorting to
unlawful arts for the purpose of discovering who should be the
successor to the Roman Emperor Valens, who died <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 378.
We are told by Ammianus Marcellinus, a contemporary historian,
that, while under torture, he thus addressed his judges:—</p>

<p class='c000'>With direful rites, O august judges, we prepared this unfortunate
little table, which you see, of laurel branches, in imitation
of the Delphic cortina, (or tripod,) and when it had been
duly consecrated by imprecation of secret charms and many
long and choric ceremonies, we at length moved it. The
method of moving it, when it was consulted on secret matters,
was as follows: It was placed in the midst of a house purified
with Arabian odors; upon it was placed a round dish, made of
various metallic substances, which had the twenty-four letters
of the alphabet curiously engraved round the rim, at accurately-measured
distances from each other. One clothed with linen
garments, carrying branches of a sacred tree, and having, by
charms framed for the purpose, propitiated the deity who is the
giver of prescience, places other lesser <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cortinæ</span> on this larger
one, with ceremonial skill. He holds over them a ring which
has been subjected to some mysterious preparation, and which
is suspended by a very fine Carpathian thread. This ring,
passing over the intervals, and falling on one letter after the
other, spells out heroic verses pertinent to the questions asked.
We then thus inquired who should succeed to the government
of the empire. The leaping ring had indicated two syllables,
(<span class='sc'>The-od</span>;) and on the addition of the last letter one of the persons
present cried out, “Theodorus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Theodorus, and many others, were executed for their share
in this dark transaction, (see Gibbon;) but Theodosius the
Great finally succeeded to the empire, and was, of course, supposed
to be the person indicated by the magic rites. The
above literal translation is given by the learned Dr. Maitland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>in a little book, lately published, <cite>Essay on False Worship</cite>,
London, 1856. The original was hardly intelligible, till light
had been thrown on it by recent practices, of which we have all
heard so much. The coincidence is, to say the least, extraordinary,
and opens views which are briefly considered in the
above-mentioned work.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AUSCULTATION AND PERCUSSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Laennec invented the stethoscope and perfected his discoveries
in the physical diagnosis of the diseases of the heart
and lungs, in 1816.</p>

<p class='c000'>Avenbrugger published his work on Percussion in 1761.</p>

<p class='c000'>One hundred and fifty years before Laennec’s suddenly conceived
act of applying a roll of paper to the breast of a female
patient gave birth to thoracic acoustics, that ingenious and
philosophic man, Robert Hooke, said in his writings:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“There may be a possibility of discovering the internal
motions and actions of bodies by the sound they make. Who
knows, but that as in a watch we may hear the beating of the
balance, and the running of the wheels, and the striking of
the hammers, and the grating of the teeth, and a multitude of
other noises,—who knows, I say, but that it may be possible to
discover the motions of internal parts of bodies, whether animal,
vegetable, or mineral, by the sounds they make?—that one
may discover the works performed in the several offices and
shops of a man’s body, and thereby discover what engine is out
of order, what works are going on at several times and lie still
at others, and the like? I have this encouragement not to
think all these things impossible, though never so much derided
by the generality of men, and never so seemingly mad,
foolish, and fantastic, that as the thinking them impossible
cannot much improve my knowledge, so the believing them
possible may perhaps be an occasion for taking notice of such
things as another would pass by without regard as useless, and
somewhat more of encouragement I have from experience that
I have been able to hear very plainly the beating of a man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>heart; and it is common to hear the motion of the wind to and
fro in the intestines; the stopping of the lungs is easily discovered
by the wheezing. As to the motion of the parts one
among the other, to their becoming sensible they require
either that their motions be increased or that the organ (the
ear) be made more nice and powerful, to sensate and distinguish
them as they are; for the doing of both which I think
it is not impossible but that in many cases there may be <span class='fss'>HELPS</span>
found.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE STEREOSCOPE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Sir David Brewster, inquiring into the history of the stereoscope,
finds that its fundamental principle was well known
even to Euclid; that it was distinctly described by Galen fifteen
hundred years ago; and that Giambattista Porta had, in 1599,
given such a complete drawing of the two separate pictures as
seen by each eye, and of the combined picture placed between
them, that we recognize in it not only the principle, but the
construction, of the stereoscope.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE DISCOVERY OF THE PLANET NEPTUNE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In his solitary study sat a young man, pale and thoughtful.
His eyes were fixed upon myriads of numerals, through whose
complexity his far-reaching mind saw into the untold mysteries
of the solar universe. His glass was not pointed to the heavens,
his eyes looked not out upon the stars, but his soul, in
deep abstraction, pondered over the perturbations of Uranus, as
noted for many a year before by many a casual observer. He
measured the intensity and the direction of the disturbing
forces, questioned the planet that was seen and known concerning
the unknown cause of its irregularities, and compelled
a star, itself beyond the reach of the common eye, to tell of the
whereabouts, the volume, the orbit, of its fellow, which no eye,
even through an optic-glass, had ever yet seen, and whose very
existence then came for the first time upon the mental vision
of the youthful sage through the power of numerical calculation.
His was a faith. It was the evidence of things not seen.
But it was like that higher and better faith of which spake the
great Apostle of the Gentiles,—fast and sure. Full of his discovery,
Le Verrier offered his conclusions to the Academy; but
learned men, when assembled in bodies, give to enthusiasts but
a cold reception. Le Verrier, sure of his position, then wrote to
Dr. Galle, the Astronomer-Royal in Berlin, asking him to point
his powerful glass to a certain quarter of the heavens, where must
be found at that time the last of the planets. And there it was;
and thence it was traced upon its mighty way, bending, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>its fellows, to the distant influence of its great centre, the sun.
There is something almost affecting in the thought that Le
Verrier should have been denied the first direct sight of the
sublime star towards which his soul had been so long leaning
and which had so long been within his mental vision. It was,
however, a fortunate loss, since his adversaries would have
charged him with having found by chance what he detected
by reason, and thus have placed in a common category one of
the most magnificent discoveries of modern times, a beautiful
illustration of the gigantic power of calculation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distance of Neptune from the sun is 2,810,000,000
miles, and the time required for its orbital revolution, 164
years. Its diameter is 41,500 miles.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE DISCOVERY OF THE PLANET VULCAN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Leverrier, encouraged and made illustrious by his success in
exploring those infinite spaces beyond the orbit of Herschel,
turned his attention to the innermost circles—the central region
of our solar system. By theoretical demonstrations, based on
irregularities in the movements of Mercury, he proved the
existence of some planet or planets lying still more closely
within the light and heat of the sun. While proceeding with
his calculations, he received a letter from Lescarbault—a poor
physician of Orgères, a village in the department of Eure
and Loire, in France—announcing the discovery of an intra-Mercurial
body, making its transit, in appearance like a small
black spot, across the disk of the sun. Possessed of a sensitive
and modest soul,—as all true lovers of science are,—the doctor
at first doubted the reality of his discovery, and hesitated to
make it known. It was only after vainly waiting nine months,
to verify his observation by another view of the object, that he
prepared a letter, narrating what he thought he had seen, and
sent it to the great Leverrier. The latter had just published
an article on Mercury’s perturbations in the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kosmos</span></cite> of
Paris. Astonished at this coincident proof of the correctness
of his theory, he lost no time in starting for the village of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Orgères, to obtain a personal interview with the humble discoverer
of the new orb. The following account of the meeting
was reported in the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kosmos</span></cite> by the Abbé Moigne, who took
it from the lips of Leverrier himself:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Leverrier left Paris for Orgères, in company with Vallee,
four days after the date of Lescarbault’s letter. Orgères was
twelve miles from the nearest railroad-station, and the party
had to foot it across the country. On their arrival, Leverrier
knocked loudly at the door, which was opened by the doctor
himself; but his visitor declined to give his name. The simple,
modest, timid Lescarbault, small in stature, stood abashed
before the tall Leverrier, who, in blunt intonation, addressed
him thus: “It is you, then, sir, who pretend to have discovered
the intra-Mercurial planet, and who have committed the grave
offence of keeping your discovery secret for nine months! I
come to do justice to your pretensions, to warn you that you
have either been dishonest or deceived. Tell me unequivocally
what you have seen.” The lamb-like doctor, trembling at this
rude summons, stammered out the following reply:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the 26th of March (1859), about four o’clock, I turned
my telescope to the sun, when, to my surprise, I saw, at a small
distance from its margin, a black spot, well defined, and perfectly
round, advancing upon the disk of the sun. A customer
called me away, and, hurrying him off as fast as I could, I
came back to my glass, when I found the round spot had continued
its transit, and I saw it disappear from the opposite
margin of the sun, after a projection upon it of an hour and a
half. I did not seize the precise moment of contact. The
spot was on the disk when I first saw it. I measured its distance
from the margin, and counted the time it took to make
the same distance, and so approximated the instant of its
entry.” “To count time is easy to say,” said Leverrier; “but
where is your chronometer?” “My chronometer is this
watch, that beats only minutes,—the faithful companion of my
professional labors.” “What! with that old watch? How dare
you talk of counting seconds? My suspicions are too well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>founded.” “Pardon me, sir, but I have a pendulum that
nearly beats seconds, and I will bring it down to show you.”
He goes above-stairs and brings down a silken thread, the
upper end of which he fastens to a nail, and brings to rest the
ivory ball at the lower end. He then starts it from the vertical,
and its oscillations beat seconds very nearly. “This is
not enough, sir: how do you count these seconds while in the
act of observing?” “My profession is to feel pulses and
count their pulsations, and my pendulum puts my seconds into
my ears, and I have no difficulty in counting them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But where is your telescope?” The doctor showed Leverrier
his glass, which was one of Cauchoix’s best. It was four
inches in diameter, and mounted on a rude stand. He took the
wondering astronomer-imperial to his roof, where he was building
a rude revolving platform and dome. “This is all very well;
but where is your original memorandum?” The doctor ran and
got his almanac, or <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Connaissance des Temps</span></cite>, and in it he finds
a square piece of paper, used as a marker, and on it, all covered
with grease and laudanum, is the original memorandum! “But
you have falsified the time of emergence. It is four minutes
too late by this memorandum.” “It is; but the four minutes
are the error of my watch, which I corrected by sidereal time,
by the aid of this little telescope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how did you determine the two angular co-ordinates
of the point of contact, of the entry and emergence of the
planet, and how did you measure the chord of the arc between
them?” Having explained the simple method which he
pursued in the premises to the satisfaction of the astronomer,
the latter next inquired after his rough drafts of calculation
for determining the distance of the planet from the sun. “My
rough draughts! Paper is scarce with us. I am a joiner as
well as an astronomer. I write on my boards, and when I am
done, I plane them off and begin again; but I think I have
preserved them.” On visiting the shop, they found the board,
with all its lines and numbers still unobliterated!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Parisian savant was now convinced that Lescarbault
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>had really seen the planet whose existence he had himself
foretold. Turning to the amateur astronomer, he revealed his
personality, and congratulated his humble brother on the magnificent
discovery thus confirmed. It was the event in the
Orgères physician’s life. Honors poured in upon him. The
cross of the Legion of Honor was sent to him from Paris, and
his name was at once enrolled in the lists of the leading
scientific academies of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new orb, whose revolution is performed in 19 days, 17
hours, has been felicitously named Vulcan. If objection be
offered to the selection of names for the planets from “Olympus’
dread hierarchy,” it must at least be acknowledged that there
is a peculiar fitness in their distribution.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>During the fourth voyage of Columbus, while prosecuting
his discoveries among the West India Islands and along the
coast of the continent, his vessels, from continual subjection to
tempestuous weather, and being, to use his own expression,
“bored by the worms as full of holes as a honey-comb,” were
reduced to mere wrecks, unable any longer to keep the sea, and
were finally stranded on the shore of Jamaica. Being beyond
the possibility of repair, they were fitted up for the temporary
use of Columbus, who was in feeble health, and of such of his
crew as were disabled by sickness, those who were well being
sent abroad for assistance and supplies. Their immediate
wants were amply provided for, Diego Mendez having made
arrangements with the natives for a daily exchange of knives,
combs, beads, fish-hooks, &amp;c., for cassava bread, fish, and other
provisions. In the course of a short time, however, provisions
on the island became scarce, and the supplies began gradually
to fall off. The arrangements for the daily delivery of certain
quantities were irregularly attended to, and finally ceased entirely.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>The Indians no longer thronged to the harbor with
provisions, and often refused them when applied for. The
Spaniards were obliged to forage about the neighborhood for
their daily food, but found more and more difficulty in procuring
it; and now, in addition to their other causes of despondency,
they began to entertain horrible apprehensions of
famine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The admiral heard the melancholy forebodings of his men,
and beheld the growing evil, but was at a loss for a remedy.
To resort to force was an alternative full of danger, and of but
temporary efficacy. It would require all those who were well
enough to bear arms to sally forth, while he and the rest of the
infirm would be left defenceless on board the wreck, exposed to
the vengeance of the natives.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time, the scarcity daily increased. The Indians
perceived the wants of the white men, and had learned from
them the art of making bargains. They asked ten times the
former quantity of European articles for a given amount of
provisions, and brought their supplies in scanty quantities, to
enhance the eagerness of the Spaniards. At length even this
relief ceased, and there was an absolute distress for want of
food, the natives withholding all provisions, in hopes either of
starving the admiral and his people, or of driving them from
the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this extremity, a fortunate idea suddenly presented itself
to Columbus. From his knowledge of astronomy, he ascertained
that within three days there would be a total eclipse of the moon,
in the early part of the night. He sent, therefore, an Indian of
the island of Hispaniola, who served as his interpreter, to summon
the principal caciques to a grand conference, appointing for
it the day of the eclipse. When all were assembled, he told
them, by his interpreter, that he and his followers were worshippers
of a deity who lived in the skies; that this deity favored such
as did well, but punished all transgressors; that, as they must
all have noticed, he had protected Diego Mendez and his companions
in their voyage, they having gone in obedience to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>orders of their commander, but that, on the other hand, he
had visited Francisco de Porras and his companions with all
kinds of crosses and afflictions, in consequence of their rebellion;
that this great deity was incensed against the Indians
who had refused or neglected to furnish his faithful worshippers
with provisions, and intended to chastise them with pestilence
and famine. Lest they should disbelieve this warning, a
signal would be given that very night, in the heavens. They
would behold the moon change its color, and gradually lose its
light,—a token of the fearful punishment which awaited them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the Indians were alarmed at the solemnity of this
prediction; others treated it with scoffing: all, however, awaited
with solicitude the coming of the night, and none with more
than Columbus himself, who was distracted with anxiety lest
the weather should prove cloudy or rainy. Imagine his gratitude
when the evening sky appeared undimmed by a cloud!
When the time arrived, and the natives beheld a dark shadow
stealing over the moon, they began to tremble. Their fears
increased with the progress of the eclipse; and when they saw
mysterious darkness covering the whole face of nature, there
were no bounds to their terror. Seizing upon whatever provisions
they could procure, they hurried to the ships, uttering
cries and lamentations. They threw themselves at the feet of
Columbus, implored him to intercede with his God to avert
the threatened calamities, and assured him that thenceforth
they would bring him whatever he required. Columbus told
them that he would retire and commune with the deity. Shutting
himself up in his cabin, he remained there during the increase
of the eclipse, the forests and shores all the while resounding
with the howlings and supplications of the savages.
When the eclipse was about to diminish, he came forth and
informed the natives that he had interceded for them with his
God, who, on condition of their fulfilling their promises, had
deigned to pardon them; in sign of which he would withdraw
the darkness from the moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Indians saw that planet restored presently to its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>brightness and rolling in all its beauty through the firmament,
they overwhelmed the admiral with thanks for his intercession,
and repaired to their homes, joyful at having escaped such
great disasters. They now regarded Columbus with awe and
reverence, as a man in the peculiar favor and confidence of the
Deity, since he knew upon earth what was passing in the heavens.
They hastened to propitiate him with gifts, supplies
again arrived daily at the harbor, and from that time forward
there was no want of provisions.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A LESSON WORTH LEARNING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The possibility of a great change being introduced by very
slight beginnings may be illustrated by a tale which Lockman
tells of a vizier, who, having offended his master, was condemned
to perpetual captivity in a lofty tower. At night his
wife came to weep below his window. “Cease your grief,”
said the sage: “go home for the present, and return hither
when you have procured a live black beetle, together with a
little <i>ghee</i>, [or buffalo’s butter,] three clews,—one of the finest
silk, another of stout pack-thread, and another of whip-cord;
finally, a stout coil of rope.” When she again came to the foot
of the tower, provided according to her husband’s demands,
he directed her to touch the head of the insect with a little of
the <i>ghee</i>, to tie one end of the silk thread around him, and
to place him on the wall of the tower. Attracted by the
smell of the butter, which he conceived to be in store somewhere
above him, the beetle continued to ascend till he reached
the top, and thus put the vizier in possession of the end of the
silk thread, who drew up the pack-thread by means of the silk,
the small cord by means of the pack-thread, and, by means of
the cord, a stout rope capable of sustaining his own weight,—and
so at last escaped from the place of his duress.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHOOSING A KING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Tyrians having been much weakened by long wars with
the Persians, their slaves rose in a body, slew their masters and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>their children, took possession of their property, and married
their wives. The slaves, having thus obtained everything,
consulted about the choice of a king, and agreed that he who
should first discern the sun rise should be king. One of them,
being more merciful than the rest, had in the general massacre
spared his master, Straton, and his son, whom he hid in a cave;
and to his old master he now resorted for advice as to this competition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straton advised his slave that when others looked to the
east he should look toward the west. Accordingly, when the
rebel tribe had all assembled in the fields, and every man’s
eyes were fixed upon the east, Straton’s slave, turning his back
upon the rest, looked only westward. He was scoffed at by
every one for his absurdity, but immediately he espied the sunbeams
upon the high towers and chimneys in the city, and, announcing
the discovery, claimed the crown as his reward.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a meeting of the French Academy of Medicine, a few
years ago, a curious paper was read, on behalf of M. Dubois, of
Amiens, entitled “Investigations into the death of Julius
Cæsar.” M. Dubois having looked up the various passages referring
to this famous historic incident to be found in Dion
Cassius, Plutarch, Suetonius, Appian, &amp;c., and compared them
with one another, has fixed the spots where the four first
wounds were inflicted, and the names of the conspirators who
inflicted them. The first blow, struck by one of the brothers
Casca, produced a slight wound underneath the left clavicle;
the second, struck by the other Casca, penetrated the walls
of the thorax toward the right; Cassius inflicted the third
wound in the face. Decimus Brutus gave the fourth stab in
the region of the groin. Contrary to the general opinion,
Marcus Brutus, though one of the conspirators, did not strike
the dictator. After the first blows Cæsar fainted, and then all
the conspirators hacked his body. He was carried by three
slaves in a litter to his house. Anstistius, the physician, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>called in and found thirty-five wounds, only one of which was
in his opinion fatal, that of the second Casca.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LAW LOGIC.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Judge Blackstone says, in his <cite>Commentaries</cite> (Vol. i. ch.
xviii.), that every Bishop, Parson or Vicar is <i>a Corporation</i>.
Lord Coke asserts, in his Reports (10. Rep. 32,) that “<i>a Corporation
has no soul</i>.” Upon these premises, the logical inference
would be that neither Bishops, Parsons nor Vicars have
souls.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RECIPROCAL CONVERSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A curious case of mixed process of conversion<a id='t407'></a> was that of
the two brothers, Dr. John Reynold’s, King’s Professor at Oxford,
in 1630, a zealous Roman Catholic, and Dr. Wm. Reynolds,
an eminent Protestant. They were both learned men, and as
brothers held such affectionate relations, that the deadly heresies
of which each regarded the other as the victim were matters
of earnest and pleading remonstrance between them by discussion
and correspondence. The pains and zeal of each were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>equally rewarded. The Roman Catholic brother became an
ardent Protestant, and the Protestant brother became a Roman
Catholic.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PITHY PRAYER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>We are indebted to Hume for the preservation of a short
prayer, which he says was that of Lord Astley, before he charged
at Edge-hill. It ran thus: “O Lord, thou knowest how busy I
must be this day; if I forget thee, do not thou forget me.” And
Hume adds, “There were certainly much longer prayers in the
Parliamentary army, but I doubt if there was as good a one.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MELROSE BY SUNLIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The beautiful description of the appearance of the ruins of
Melrose Abbey by moonlight, in the <cite>Lay of the Last Minstrel</cite>,
has led thousands to visit the scene “when silver edges the
imagery,” yet it is worth noting that the author never saw the
ruined pile by “the pale moonlight.” Bernard Barton once
wrote to Scott to request him to favor a young lady with a copy
of the lines in his own handwriting. Sir Walter complied,
but substituted for the concluding lines of the original the
following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

<h3 class='c012'>BACK ACTION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Alphonse Karr, in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guêpes</span></cite>, speaking of the dexterities
of the legal profession, relates a pleasant anecdote of the distinguished
lawyer, afterward deputy, M. Chaix d’Est-Ange. He
was employed in a case where both the parties were old men.
Referring to his client, he said: “He has attained that age,
when the mind, freed from the passions, and tyranny of the
body, takes a higher flight, and soars in a purer and serener
air.” Later in his speech, he found occasion to allude to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>opposite party, of whom he remarked: “I do not deny his
natural intelligence; but he has reached an age in which the
mind participates in the enfeeblement, the decrepitude, and the
degradation of the body.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE AUDITORIUMS OF THE LAST CENTURY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When we read of Patrick Henry’s wonderful displays of
eloquence, we naturally figure to ourselves a spacious interior
and a great crowd of rapt listeners. But, in truth, those of his
orations which quickened or changed the march of events, and
the thrill of which has been felt in the nerves of four generations,
were all delivered in small rooms and to few hearers, never more
than one hundred and fifty. The first thought of the visitor to
St. John’s Church in Richmond, is: Could it have been <i>here</i>, in
this oaken chapel of fifty or sixty pews, that Patrick Henry
delivered the greatest and best known of all his speeches? Was
it here that he uttered those words of doom, so unexpected, so
unwelcome, “We must fight”? Even here. And the words
were spoken in a tone and manner worthy of the men to whom
they were addressed—with quiet and profound solemnity.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TRUE FORM OF THE CROSS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The ancient and ignominious punishment of crucifixion was
abolished by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, who
thought it indecent and irreligious that the Cross should be
used for the putting to death of the vilest offenders, while he
himself erected it as a trophy, and esteemed it the noblest
ornament of his diadem and military standards. In consequence
of his decree, crucifixion has scarcely been witnessed in
Europe for the last 1500 years. Those painters, sculptors,
poets and writers who have attempted to describe it have,
therefore, followed their own imagination or vague tradition
rather than the evidence of history. But they could hardly
do otherwise, because the writings of the early fathers of the
Church and of pagan historians were not generally accessible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>to them until after the revival of learning in the Fifteenth
Century, and because the example of depicting the cross once
given had been religiously followed by the earliest painters and
sculptors, and universally accepted without question; and to
object to the generally received form would have been deemed
sacrilegious. These two reasons may have been sufficient to
deter the great artists of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries from making any change; there may, however, have
been a third, quite as potent (if not more so), and that is that
the introduction of the lower projecting beam, <i>astride</i> of which
the crucified person was <i>seated</i>, would have been both inartistic
and indecent, yet this third piece was invariably used when the
punishment was inflicted, except in the case where the sufferer
was crucified with the head downward. The researches of two
eminent scholars of the Seventeenth Century—Salmasius and
Lipsius—have put it beyond a doubt that the cross consisted of
a strong upright post, not much taller than a man of lofty
stature, which was sharpened at the lower end, by which it
was fixed into the ground, having a short bar or stake projecting
from its middle, and a longer transverse beam firmly
joined to the upright post near the top. The condemned person
was made to carry his cross to the place of execution, after
having been first whipped; he was then stripped of his
clothing, and offered a cup of medicated wine, to impart firmness
or alleviate pain. He was then made to sit astride the
middle bar, and his limbs, having been bound with cords, the
legs to the upright beam, the arms to the transverse, were
finally secured by driving large iron spikes through the hands
and feet. The cross was then fixed in its proper position, and
the sufferer was left to die, not so much from pain (as is
generally supposed) as from exhaustion, or heat, or cold, or
hunger, or wild beasts, unless (as was usually the case) his
sufferings were put an end to by burning, stoning, suffocation,
breaking the bones, or piercing the vital organs. If left alone
he generally survived two days or three, and there are cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>recorded where the sufferer lingered till the fifth day before
dying.</p>

<p class='c000'>Referring to the earliest Christian writers, who witnessed the
crucifixion of hundreds of their martyred brethren, it will be
seen that the foregoing statement of Salmasius respecting the
true form of the cross is well founded. Irenæus, Bishop of
Lyons, in the second century, says: “The structure of the
cross has five ends or summits, two in length, two in breadth,
and one in the middle, on which the crucified person rests.”
Justin, another Christian writer of the same period, who
acquired the surname of Martyr from the cruel death he
suffered for his faith, also speaks of “that end projecting from
the middle of the upright post like a horn, on which crucified
persons are seated.” Tertullian, another Christian writer, who
lived a little later, says: “A part, and, indeed, a principal part,
of the cross is any post which is fixed in an upright position;
but to us the entire cross is imputed, including its transverse
beam, and the projecting bar which serves as a seat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This fact (of the sufferer being seated) will account for the
long duration of the punishment; the wounds in the hands
and feet did not lacerate any large vessel, and were nearly closed
by the nails which produced them. The Rev. Alban Butler, in
his <cite>Lives of the Saints</cite>, gives numerous instances of the lingering
nature of this mode of execution, and of the wonderful
heroism displayed by the Christians who underwent it. The
Pagan historians also narrate instances of similar heroism on
the part of political offenders, who were put to death on the
Cross. Bomilcar, the commander of the Carthaginian army
in Sicily, having shown a disposition to desert to the enemy,
was nailed to a gibbet in the middle of the forum; but “from
the height of the Cross, as from a tribunal, he declaimed
against the crimes of the citizens; and having spoken thus
with a loud voice amid an immense concourse of the people,
he expired.” Crucifixion has been practised from the remotest
ages in the East, and is still occasionally resorted to in Turkey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Madagascar, and Northern Africa. The Jewish historian, Josephus,
states that the chief baker of Pharaoh, whose dream had
been interpreted by Joseph, was <i>crucified</i>, though Scripture
says he was <i>hanged</i>; but this may mean hanged on a cross, for
the expression seems to be almost equivalent to crucified, as
appears from Galatians, chap. III. v. 13. “Christ hath redeemed
us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us; for
it is written, ‘Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.’” As
regards art, it is not now to be expected that the example set
by the great masters will be discarded. In this, as in other
matters, custom is law, whose arbitrary sway will be exercised
in spite of facts.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SINGULAR COINCIDENCES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A. was walking with a friend near Oxford, when a snipe rose
within shot. They both “presented” their walking-sticks at
the bird, remarking what a “pretty shot” it would have been
for a gun. The snipe flew on a short distance, then towered,
and fell dead. When examined, the bird was found to be
apparently uninjured; but a close examination discovered the
trace of a former injury, which had led to the rupture of a
blood-vessel. If, instead of a walking-stick a gun had been
presented and discharged at the bird, no one would have
ventured to doubt that the death of the bird was due to the
gun.</p>

<p class='c000'>A young officer in the army of the famous Wolfe was
apparently dying of an abscess in the lungs. He was absent
from his regiment on sick-leave; but resolved to rejoin it, when
a battle was expected. “For,” said he, “since I am given
over, I had better be doing my duty; and my life’s being
shortened a few days, matters not.” He received a shot which
<i>pierced the abscess</i>, and made an opening for the discharge.
He recovered, and lived to the age of eighty.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the United Service Museum, (Whitehall Yard, London,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>are exhibited the “jaws of a shark,” wide open, and enclosing
a tin box. The history of this strange exhibition is as follows:—A
ship, on her way to the West Indies, “fell in with” and
chased a suspicious-looking craft, which had all the appearance
of a slaver. During the pursuit, the chase threw something
overboard. She was subsequently captured, and taken into
Port Royal to be tried as a slaver. In absence of the ship’s
papers and other proofs, the slaver was not only in a fair way
to escape condemnation, but her captain was anticipating the
recovery of pecuniary damages against his captor for illegal
detention. While the subject was under discussion, a vessel
came into port, which had followed closely in the track of the
chase above described. She had caught a shark; and in its
stomach was found a tin box, which contained the slaver’s
papers. Upon the strength of this evidence the slaver was
condemned. The written account is attached to the box.</p>

A. B. took the pack in his hand and carelessly tossed on the
table a card, which proved to be the correct one. The professor,
in the utmost surprise and admiration, offered to give
A. B. three of his best tricks if he would give him the secret
of the trick which he had just exhibited. A. B. coolly
declined the offer, and concealed the fact that it was all <i>chance</i>,

<p class='c000'>Upon the death of a seaman, some money became payable
to his widow, Elizabeth Smith, No. 20 (of a certain, say
“King”) Street, Wapping. The government agent called at
No. 20 King Street, and finding that Elizabeth Smith lived
there, paid the money without further inquiry. Subsequently
the true widow, Elizabeth Smith, turned up; and it was then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>discovered that, at the very time the money was paid, the
street was being <i>re-numbered</i>, and there were <i>two</i> houses
numbered 20; and what was most remarkable, there was an
Elizabeth Smith living in each of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time in the last century, a Mrs. Stephens professed to
have received from her husband a medicine for dissolving
“the stone in the bladder,” and offered to sell it to government.
In order to test the virtue of this medicine, a patient was
selected who had undeniably the complaint in question. He
took the medicine, and was soon quite well. The doctors
watched him anxiously, and when he died, many years after,
he was seized by them, and the body examined. It was then
discovered that the stone had made for itself a little sac in the
bladder, and was so tightly secured that it had never caused
any inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Government, however, (somewhat prematurely,) rewarded
Mrs. Stephens with a sum of £10,000. The cure appeared to
have been purely accidental, as the remedy was nothing but
potash, which has little or no virtue in such cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>A gentleman of fortune, named Angerstein, lost a large
quantity of valuable plate. His butler was soon on the track
of the thieves, (who had brought a coach to carry the plate),
and enquired at the first turnpike gate whether any vehicle
had lately passed. The gate-keeper stated that a hackney-coach
had shortly before gone through; and though he was
surprised at its passing by so early in the morning, he had not
noticed the “number” on the coach. A servant girl, hearing
the conversation, volunteered her statement, that she saw the
coach pass by, and its number was “45.” As the girl <i>could
not read</i>, they were surprised at her knowing the “number.”
She stated that she knew it well, as being the same number
she had long seen about the walls everywhere, which she knew
was “45,” as every one was speaking of it. This allusion of
the girl’s was in reference to the “Wilkes” disturbances, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>the 45th number of the <cite>True Briton</cite> was prosecuted, and caused
a great deal of public excitement. Mr. Angerstein’s butler
went at once to London and found out the driver of the
hackney-coach No. 45, who at once drove him to the place
where the plate was deposited, and it was all recovered.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Some years since, in the “Temple,” was a vertical sun-dial,
with the motto, “Be gone about your business.” It is stated
that this very appropriate motto was the result of the following
blunder:—When the dial was erected, the benchers were applied
to for a motto. They desired the “builder’s man” to call at the
library at a certain hour on a certain day, when he should
receive instructions. But they forgot the whole matter. On
the appointed day and hour the “builder’s man” called at the
library, and found only a lawyer in close study over a law book.
The man stated the cause of his intrusion, which suited so
badly the lawyer’s time and leisure that he bid the man sharply
“Be gone about your business.” The lawyer’s testy reply was
duly painted in big letters upon the dial, and was considered so
apposite that it was not only allowed to remain, but was considered
to be as appropriate a motto as could be chosen.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Two men in France took shelter in a barn for the night. In
the morning one of them was found dead, with severe injury
to the head. The comrade was at once arrested, and told some
“cock-and-bull” story about the terrible storm of the night in
question, and attributed his companion’s death to the effect of
a thunderbolt. He was not credited: and was in a fair way to
be executed for the supposed crime. A scientific gentleman,
hearing of the circumstance, examined the place, and found a
hole in the roof of the barn, and an aërolite close to the spot
where the deceased had slept on the night in question. The
innocence of the accused was at once considered as established,
and he was released.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Now, even in these cases, there is nothing <i>supernatural</i>, or
even <i>un</i>natural; i.e., there is nothing to <i>prevent</i> the occurrence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>The improbability is only from the enormous number of chances
against each. But when any German theologian, or other, pretends
to <i>explain a series</i> of alleged <i>miracles</i> as mere <i>accidents</i>,
he should be reminded that the chances are <i>multiplied</i> against
each repeated occurrence. If, e.g., the chances against a person’s
bagging a snipe, which died accidentally just as he pointed a
stick or a gun at it, be only <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1000</span></span>, then, against his thus obtaining
<i>two</i>, the chances would be <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>1000000</span></span>, and so on. No
one familiar with what is sometimes called the <i>Doctrine of
Chances</i> but more correctly called the <i>Theory of Probabilities</i>,
would believe that a sportsman could bring home a bag full of
game, <i>every</i> bird having died <i>accidentally</i> just when shot at.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHICK IN THE EGG.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The hen has scarcely sat on the egg twelve hours, when we
begin already to discover in it some lineaments of the head and
body of the chicken that is to be born. The heart appears to
beat at the end of the day; at the end of forty-eight hours,
two vesicles of blood can be distinguished, the pulsation of
which is very visible. At the fiftieth hour, an auricle of the
heart appears, and resembles a lace, or noose folded down
upon itself. At the end of seventy hours, we distinguish
wings, and on the head two bubbles for the brain; one for
the bill, and two others for the forepart and hindpart of
the head; the liver appears towards the fifth day. At the
end of one hundred and thirty-one hours, the first voluntary
motion is observed. At the end of one hundred and thirty-eight
hours the lungs and stomach become visible; at the
end of one hundred and forty-two, the intestines, the loins,
and the upper jaw. The seventh day, the brain, which
was slimy, begins to have some consistence. At the 190th
hour of incubation, the bill opens, and the flesh appears in
the breast. At the 194th, the sternum is seen, that is to
say, the breastbone. At the 210th, the ribs come out of
the back, the bill is very visible, as well as the gall-bladder.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>The bill becomes green at the end of two hundred and thirty-six
hours; and if the chick is taken out of its covering, it evidently
moves itself. The feathers begin to shoot out towards
the 240th hour, and the skull becomes gristly. At the 264th,
the eyes appear. At the 288th, the ribs are perfect. At the
331st, the spleen draws near to the stomach, and the lungs to
the chest. At the end of three hundred and fifty-five hours,
the bill frequently opens and shuts; and at the end of four
hundred and fifty-one hours, or the eighteenth day, the first cry
of the chick is already heard: it afterwards gets more strength,
and grows continually, till at last it sets itself at liberty, by
opening the prison in which it was shut up. Thus is it by so
many different degrees that these creatures are brought into life.
All these progressions are made by rule, and there is not one
of them without sufficient reason. No part of its body could
appear sooner or later without the whole embryo suffering; and
each of its limbs appears at the proper moment. How manifestly
is this ordination—so wise, and so invariable in the production
of the animal—the work of a Supreme Being!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>INNATE APPETITE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>McKenzie, in his <cite>Phrenological Essays</cite>, mentions the following
curious fact, witnessed by Sir James Hall. He had been
engaged in making some experiments on hatching eggs by artificial
heat, and on one occasion observed in one of his boxes a
chicken in the act of breaking from its confinement. It happened
that just as the creature was getting out of the shell, a
spider began to run along the box, when the chicken darted
forward, seized and swallowed it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE INDIAN AND HIS TAMED SNAKE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>An Indian had tamed a blacksnake, which he kept about
him during the summer months. In autumn he let the creature
go whither it chose to crawl, but told it to come to him
again upon a certain day, which he named, in the spring. A
white man who was present, and saw what was done, and heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>the Indian affirm that the serpent would return to him the very
day he had appointed, had no faith in the truth of his prediction.
The next spring, however, retaining the day in his memory,
curiosity led him to the place, where he found the Indian
in waiting; and, after remaining with him about two hours, the
serpent came crawling back, and put himself under the care of
his old master.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this case, the Indian had probably observed that blacksnakes
usually return to their old haunts at the same vernal
season; and as he had tamed, fed, and kept this snake in a particular
place, experience taught him that it would return on a
certain day.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ALLIGATORS SWALLOWING STONES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Indians on the banks of the Oronoko assert that previously
to an alligator going in search of prey it always swallows
a large stone, that it may acquire additional weight to aid it in
diving and dragging its victims under water. A traveller being
somewhat incredulous on this point, Bolivar, to convince him,
shot several with his rifle, and in all of them were found stones
varying in weight according to the size of the animal. The
largest killed was about seventeen feet in length, and had within
him a stone weighing about sixty or seventy pounds.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HABITS OF SHEEP.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Never jumps a sheep that’s frightened</div>
      <div class='line'>Over any fence whatever,</div>
      <div class='line'>Over wall, or fence, or timber,</div>
      <div class='line'>But a second follows after,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a third upon the second,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a fourth, and fifth, and so on,</div>
      <div class='line'>When they see the tail uplifted,—</div>
      <div class='line'>First a sheep, and then a dozen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till they all, in quick succession,</div>
      <div class='line'>One by one, have got clear over.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Anderson, of Liverpool, relates the following amusing
illustration of the singularly persevering disposition of sheep
to follow their leader wherever he goes:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>A butcher’s boy was driving about twenty fat wethers
through the town, but they ran down a street where he did not
want them to go. He observed a scavenger at work, and called
out loudly for him to stop the sheep. The man accordingly did
what he could to turn them back, running from side to side,
always opposing himself to their passage, and brandishing his
broom with great dexterity; but the sheep, much agitated,
pressed forward, and at last one of them came right up to the
man, who, fearing it was going to jump over his head, whilst
he was stooping, grasped the broom with both hands and held
it over his head. He stood for a few seconds in this position,
when the sheep made a spring and jumped fairly over him,
without touching the broom. The first had no sooner cleared
this impediment than another followed, and another, in quick
succession, so that the man, perfectly confounded, seemed to
lose all recollection, and stood in the same attitude till the
whole of them had jumped over him, and not one attempted
to pass on either side, although the street was quite clear.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>REMARKABLE EQUESTRIAN EXPEDITIONS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Cooper Thornhill, an innkeeper at Stilton, in Huntingdonshire,
rode from that place to London and back again, and
also a second time to London, in one day,—which made a journey
in all of two hundred and thirteen miles. He undertook
to ride this journey with several horses in fifteen hours, but
performed it in twelve hours and a quarter. This remarkable
feat gave rise to a poem called the Stilton Hero, which was
published in the year 1745.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years ago, Lord James Cavendish rode from Hyde
Park Corner to Windsor Lodge, which is upwards of twenty
miles, in less than an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Robert Cary rode nearly three hundred miles in less than
three days, when he went from London to Edinburgh to inform
King James of the death of Queen Elizabeth. He had several
falls and sore bruises on the road, which occasioned his going
battered and bloody into the royal presence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>On the 29th of August, 1750, was decided at Newmarket a
remarkable wager for one thousand guineas, laid by Theobald
Taaf, Esq., against the Earl of March and Lord Eglinton, who
were to provide a four-wheel carriage with a man in it, to be
drawn by four horses nineteen miles in an hour. The match
was performed in fifty-three minutes and twenty-four seconds.
An engraved model of the carriage was formerly sold in the
print-shops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Marquis de la Fayette rode in August, 1778, from
Rhode Island to Boston, nearly seventy miles distant, in seven
hours, and returned in six and a half.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fozard, of Park Lane, London, for a wager of one hundred
and fifty pounds against one hundred pounds, undertook to
ride forty miles in two hours, over Epsom course. He rode
two miles more than had been agreed on, and performed it in
five minutes under time, in October, 1789.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wilde, an Irish gentleman, lately rode one hundred and
twenty-seven miles on the course of Kildare, in Ireland, in six
hours and twenty minutes, for a wager of one thousand guineas.</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous Count de Montgomery escaped from the massacre
of Paris in 1572, through the swiftness of his horse, which,
according to a manuscript of that time, carried him ninety miles
without halting.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WONDERFUL HORSE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the year 1609, an Englishman named Banks had a horse
which he had trained to follow him wherever he went, even
over fences and to the roofs of buildings. He and his horse
went to the top of that immensely high structure, St. Paul’s
Church. After many extraordinary performances at home, the
horse and his master went to Rome, where they performed feats
equally astonishing. But the result was that both Banks and
his horse were burned, by order of the Pope, as enchanters.
Sir Walter Raleigh observes, that had Banks lived in olden
times, he would have shamed all the enchanters of the world,
for no beast ever performed such wonders as his.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>Fortunately, for men like Thorne, and Rice, and Franconi,
who have been so successful in training the noblest animal in
creation for the stage-representations of Mazeppa, Putnam’s
Leap, &amp;c., and for the various and fantastic tricks which have
won so much admiration and applause, the present age is not
disgraced by such besotted ignorance and superstition.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WONDERFUL LOCK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the wonderful products of art in the French Crystal
Palace was shown a lock which admits of 3,674,385 combinations.
Heuret passed a hundred and twenty nights in locking
it, and Fichet was four months in unlocking it; now they can
neither shut nor open it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CELERITY OF CLOTH-MANUFACTURE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Many accounts have been published of the celerity with
which manufacturers of cloth, both English and American, have
completed the various parts of the process, from the fleece
to the garment. In England the fleece was taken from the
sheep, manufactured into cloth, and the cloth made into a coat,
in the short space of thirteen hours and twenty minutes.
Messrs. Buck, Brewster &amp; Co., proprietors of the Ontario manufactory
at Manchester, Vermont, on perusing an account of this
English achievement, conceived, from the perfection of their
machinery and the dexterity of their workmen, that the same
operations might be accomplished even in a shorter time. A
wager of five hundred dollars was offered, and accepted, that
they would perform the same operations in twelve hours. The
wool was taken from the sack in its natural state, and in nine
hours and fifteen minutes precisely, the coat was completed,
and worn in triumph by one of the party concerned. The wool
was picked, greased, carded, roped, and spun,—the yarn was
worked, put into the loom and woven,—the cloth was fulled,
colored, and four times shorn, pressed, and carried to the
tailor’s, and the coat completed,—all within the time above stated.
The cloth was not of the finest texture, but was very handsomely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>dressed, and fitted the person who wore it remarkably
well. The only difference between this and the English experiment
was the time occupied in shearing the fleece; and any
wool-grower knows that this part of the operation may be performed
in ten minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CRUDE VALUE <i>versus</i> INDUSTRIAL VALUE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Algarotti, in his Opuscula, gives the following example to
show the prodigious addition of value that may be given to an
object by skill and industry. A pound weight of pig-iron costs
the operative manufacturer about five cents. This is worked
up into steel, of which is made the little spiral spring that
moves the balance-wheel of a watch. Each of these springs
weighs but the tenth part of a grain, and, when completed, may
be sold as high as $3.00, so that out of a pound of iron, allowing
something for the loss of metal, eighty thousand of these
springs may be made, and a substance worth but five cents be
wrought into a value of $240,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>An American gentleman says, that during a recent visit to
Manchester, England, a pound of cotton, which in its crude
state may have been worth eight cents, was pointed out to him
as worth a pound of gold. It had been spun into a thread
that would go round the globe at the equator and tie in a good
large knot of many hundred miles in length.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>QUANTITY AND VALUE.</h3>

<p class='c000'>When emeralds were first discovered in America, a Spaniard
carried one to a lapidary in Italy, and asked him what it was
worth; he was told a hundred <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">escudos</span></i>. He produced a second,
which was larger; and that was valued at three hundred. Overjoyed
at this, he took the lapidary to his lodging and showed
him a chest full; but the Italian, seeing so many, damped his
joy by saying, “Ah ha, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Señor</span>! so many!—these are worth
<i>one</i> <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">escudo</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>Montenegro presented to the elder Almagro the first cat
which was brought to South America, and was rewarded for it
with six hundred <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">pesos</span></i>. The first couple of cats which were
carried to Cuyaba sold for a pound of gold. There was a
plague of rats in the settlement, and they were purchased as a
speculation, which proved an excellent one. Their first kittens
produced thirty <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">oitavas</span></i> each; the next generation were worth
twenty; and the price gradually fell as the inhabitants were
stocked with these beautiful and useful creatures.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AMOUNT OF GOLD IN THE WORLD.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Estimate the yard of gold at £2,000,000, (which it is in round
numbers,) and all the gold in the world might, if melted into
ingots, be contained in a cellar twenty-four feet square and sixteen
feet high. All the boasted wealth already obtained from
California and Australia would go into a safe nine feet square
and nine feet high; so small is the cube of yellow metal that
has set populations on the march and occasioned such wondrous
revolutions in the affairs of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The contributions of the people, in the time of David, for
the sanctuary, exceeded £6,800,000. The immense treasure
David is said to have collected for the sanctuary amounted to
£889,000,000 sterling, (Crito says £798,000,000,)—a sum
greater than the British national debt. The gold with which
Solomon overlaid the “most holy place,” a room only thirteen
feet square, amounted to more than thirty-eight millions
sterling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The products of the California mines from 1853 to 1858 are
put down at $443,091,000; those of Australia, since their discovery,
at $296,813,000; or $739,904,000 in all,—an increase of
about one-third, according to the best statistical writers, on the
value of this precious metal known in 1850. The total value
of gold in the world at the present time, then, is but little
more than $3,000,000,000.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>WINE AT TWO MILLIONS A BOTTLE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Wine at two millions of dollars a bottle is a drink that in
expense would rival the luxurious taste of barbaric splendor,
when priceless pearls were thrown into the wine-cup to give a
rich flavor to its contents; yet that there is such a costly
beverage, is a fixed fact. In the Rose apartment (so called
from a bronze bas-relief) of the ancient cellar under the
Hotel de Ville in the city of Bremen is the famous Rosenwein,
deposited there nearly two centuries and a half ago. There
were twelve large cases, each bearing the name of one of the
apostles; and the wine of Judas, despite the reprobation
attached to his name, is to this day more highly esteemed
than the others. One case of the wine, containing five oxhoft
of two hundred and four bottles, cost five hundred rix-dollars
in 1624. Including the expenses of keeping up the cellar,
and of the contributions, interests of the amounts, and interests
upon interests, an oxhoft costs at the present time
555,657,640 rix-dollars, and consequently a bottle is worth
2,723,812 rix-dollars; a glass, or the eighth part of a bottle, is
worth 340,476 rix-dollars, or $272,380; or at the rate of 540
rix-dollars, or $272, per drop. A burgomaster of Bremen is
privileged to have one bottle whenever he entertains a distinguished
guest who enjoys a German or European reputation.
The fact illustrates the operation of interest, if it does not
show the cost of luxury.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CAPACIOUS BEER-CASKS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A few years before Mr. Thrale’s death, which happened in
1781, an emulation arose among the brewers to exceed each
other in the size of their casks for keeping beer to a certain
age,—probably, says Sir John Hawkins, taking the hint from
the tun at Heidelberg, of which the following is a description:</p>

<p class='c000'>At Heidelberg, on the river Neckar, near its junction with
the Rhine, in Germany, there was a tun or wine-vessel constructed
in 1343, which contained twenty-one pipes. Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>was made, or the one now mentioned rebuilt, in 1664, which
held six hundred hogsheads, English measure. This was emptied,
and knocked to pieces by the French, in 1688. But a new
and larger one was afterwards fabricated, which held eight hundred
hogsheads. It was formerly kept full of the best Rhenish
wine, and the Electors have given many entertainments on its
platform; but this convivial monument of ancient hospitality is
now, says Mr. Walker, but a melancholy, unsocial, solitary instance
of the extinction of hospitality: it moulders in a damp
vault, quite empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The celebrated tun at Königstein is said to be the most capacious
cask in the world,—holding 1,869,236 pints. The top
is railed in, and it affords room for twenty people to regale
themselves. There are also several kinds of welcome-cups,
which are offered to strangers, who are invited by a Latin inscription
to drink to the prosperity of the whole universe.
This enormous tun was built in 1725, by Frederick Augustus,
King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, who, in the inscription
just mentioned, is styled “the father of his country, the
Titus of his age, and the delight of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Johnson once mentioned that his friend Thrale had four
casks so large that each of them held one thousand hogsheads.
But Mr. Meux, of Liquorpond Street, Gray’s Inn Lane, could,
according to Mr. Pennant, show twenty-four vessels containing
in all thirty-five thousand barrels: one alone held four thousand
five hundred barrels; and in the year 1790 this enterprising
brewer built another, containing nearly twelve thousand
barrels, valued at about £20,000. A dinner was given to
two hundred people at the bottom of it, and two hundred more
joined the company to drink success to this unrivalled vat.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ENGLISH POETS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Chaucer describes men and things as they <i>are</i>; Shakspeare,
as they <i>would be</i> under the circumstances supposed; Spenser,
as we would <i>wish</i> them to be; Milton, as they <i>ought</i> to be; Byron,
as they ought <i>not</i> to be; and Shelley, as they never <i>can</i> be.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>PERILS OF PRECOCITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Baillet mentions one hundred and sixty-three children
endowed with extraordinary talents, among whom few arrived
at an advanced age. The two sons of Quintilian so vaunted
by their father did not reach their tenth year. Hermogenes,
who at the age of fifteen taught rhetoric to Marcus Aurelius,
who triumphed over the most celebrated rhetoricians of Greece,
did not die at an early age, but at twenty-four lost his faculties
and forgot all he had previously acquired. Pico di Mirandola
died at thirty-two; Johannus Secundus at twenty-five, having
at the age of fifteen composed admirable Greek and Latin
verses and become profoundly versed in jurisprudence and
letters. Pascal, whose genius developed itself when ten years
old, did not attain the third of a century. In 1791, a child
was born at Lubeck, named Henri Heinneken, whose precocity
was miraculous. At ten months of age he spoke distinctly, at
twelve learned the Pentateuch by rote, and at fourteen months
was perfectly acquainted with the Old and New Testament.
At two years he was as familiar with geography and ancient
history as the most erudite authors of antiquity. In the
ancient and modern languages he was a proficient. This wonderful
child was unfortunately carried off in his fourth year.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE BLACK HOLE AT CALCUTTA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This celebrated place of confinement was only eighteen feet
by eighteen, containing, therefore, three hundred and twenty-four
square feet. When Fort William was taken, in 1756, by Surajah
Dowla, Nabob of Bengal, one hundred and forty-six persons
were shut up in the Black Hole. The room allowed to each
person a space of twenty-six and a half inches by twelve inches,
which was just sufficient to hold them without their pressing
violently on each other. To this dungeon there was but one small
grated window, and, the weather being very sultry, the air
within could neither circulate nor be changed. In less than an
hour, many of the prisoners were attacked with extreme difficulty
of breathing; several were delirious; and the place was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>filled with incoherent ravings, in which the cry for water was
predominant. This was handed them by the sentinels, but
without the effect of allaying their thirst. In less than four
hours, many were suffocated, or died in violent delirium. In
five hours, the survivors, except those at the grate, were frantic
and outrageous. At length most of them became insensible.
Eleven hours after they were imprisoned, twenty-three only, of
the one hundred and forty-six, came out alive, and those were
in a highly-putrid fever, from which, however, by fresh air and
proper attention, they gradually recovered.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STONE BAROMETER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A Finland newspaper mentions a stone in the northern part
of Finland, which serves the inhabitants instead of a barometer.
This stone, which they call Ilmakiur, turns black, or blackish
gray, when it is going to rain, but on the approach of fine weather
it is covered with white spots. Probably it is a fossil
mixed with clay, and containing rock-salt, nitre, or ammonia,
which, according to the greater or less degree of dampness of
the atmosphere, attracts it, or otherwise. In the latter case
the salt appears, forming the white spots.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BITTERNESS OF STRYCHNIA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Strychnia, the active principle of the Nux Vomica bean,
which has become so famous in the annals of criminal poisoning,
is so intensely bitter that it will impart a sensibly bitter
taste to six hundred thousand times its weight of water.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SALT, AS A LUXURY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mungo Park describes salt as “the greatest of all luxuries in
Central Africa.” Says he, “It would appear strange to a
European to see a child suck a piece of rock-salt, as if it were
sugar. This, however, I have frequently seen; although in
the inland parts the poorer class of inhabitants are so very
rarely indulged with this precious article, that to say a man
eats salt with his victuals is the same as saying that he is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>rich man. I have myself suffered great inconvenience from
the scarcity of this article. The long-continued use of vegetable
food creates so painful a longing for salt, that no words
can sufficiently describe it.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SINGULAR CHANGE OF TASTE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The sense by which we appreciate the sweetness of bodies is
liable to singular modifications. Thus, the leaves of the <i>Gymnema
sylvestre</i>,—a plant of Northern India,—when chewed,
take away the power of tasting sugar for twenty-four hours,
without otherwise injuring the general sense of taste.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BLUNDERS OF PAINTERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Tintoret, an Italian painter, in a picture of the Children of
Israel gathering manna, has taken the precaution to arm them
with the modern invention of guns. Cigoli painted the aged
Simeon at the circumcision of the infant Saviour; and as aged
men in these days wear spectacles, the artist has shown his
sagacity by placing them on Simeon’s nose. In a picture by
Verrio of Christ healing the sick, the lookers-on are represented
as standing with periwigs on their heads. To match, or rather
to exceed, this ludicrous representation, Durer has painted the
expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden by an
angel in a dress fashionably trimmed with flounces. The same
painter, in his scene of Peter denying Christ, represents a
Roman soldier very comfortably smoking a pipe of tobacco. A
Dutch painter, in a picture of the Wise Men worshipping the
Holy Child, has drawn one of them in a large white surplice,
and in boots and spurs, and he is in the act of presenting to
the child a model of a Dutch man-of-war. In a Dutch picture
of Abraham offering up his son, instead of the patriarch’s
“stretching forth his hand and taking the knife,” as the Scriptures
inform us, he is represented as using a more effectual and
modern instrument: he is holding to Isaac’s head a <i>blunderbuss</i>.
Berlin represents in a picture the Virgin and Child listening
to a violin; and in another picture he has drawn King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>David playing the harp at the marriage of Christ with St.
Catherine. A French artist has drawn, with true French
taste, the Lord’s Supper, with the table ornamented with tumblers
filled with cigar-lighters; and, as if to crown the list of
these absurd and ludicrous anachronisms, the garden of Eden
has been drawn with Adam and Eve in all their primeval simplicity
and virtue, while near them, in full costume, is seen a
hunter with a gun, shooting ducks.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MINUTE MECHANISM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>There is a cherry-stone at the Salem (Mass.) Museum, which
contains one dozen silver spoons. The stone itself is of the
ordinary size; but the spoons are so small that their shape and
finish can only be well distinguished by the microscope. Here
is the result of immense labor for no decidedly useful purpose;
and there are thousands of other objects in the world fashioned
by ingenuity, the value of which, in a utilitarian sense, may be
said to be quite as indifferent. Dr. Oliver gives an account of
a cherry-stone on which were carved one hundred and twenty-four
heads, so distinctly that the naked eye could distinguish
those belonging to popes and kings by their mitres and crowns.
It was bought in Prussia for fifteen thousand dollars, and thence
conveyed to England, where it was considered an object of so
much value that its possession was disputed, and it became the
object of a suit in chancery. One of the Nuremberg toy-makers
enclosed in a cherry-stone, which was exhibited at the
French Crystal Palace, a plan of Sevastopol, a railway-station,
and the “Messiah” of Klopstock. In more remote times, an
account is given of an ivory chariot, constructed by Mermecides,
which was so small that a fly could cover it with his
wing; also a ship of the same material, which could be hidden
under the wing of a bee! Pliny, too, tells us that Homer’s
Iliad, with its fifteen thousand verses, was written in so small a
space as to be contained in a nutshell; while Elian mentions
an artist who wrote a distich in letters of gold, which he enclosed
in the rind of a kernel of corn. But the Harleian MS.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>mentions a greater curiosity than any of the above, it being nothing
more nor less than the Bible, written by one Peter Bales,
a chancery clerk, in so small a book that it could be enclosed
within the shell of an English walnut. Disraeli gives an account
of many other exploits similar to the one of Bales.
There is a drawing of the head of Charles II. in the library of
St. John’s College, Oxford, wholly composed of minute written
characters, which at a small distance resemble the lines of an
engraving. The head and the ruff are said to contain the book
of Psalms, in Greek, and the Lord’s Prayer. In the British
Museum is a portrait of Queen Anne, not much larger than
the hand. On this drawing are a number of lines and scratches,
which, it is asserted, comprise the entire contents of a thin
folio. The modern art of Photography is capable of effecting
wonders in this way. We have before us the Declaration of
Independence, containing seven thousand eight hundred letters,
on a space not larger than the head of a pin, which, when
viewed through a microscope, may be read distinctly.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE RATIO OF THE DIAMETER TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The proportion of the diameter of a circle to its circumference
has never yet been exactly ascertained. Nor can a square
or any other right-lined figure be found that shall be equal to a
given circle. This is the celebrated problem called the squaring
of the circle, which has exercised the abilities of the greatest
mathematicians for ages and been the occasion of so many
disputes. Several persons of considerable eminence have, at
different times, pretended that they had discovered the exact
quadrature; but their errors have readily been detected; and it
is now generally looked upon as a thing impossible to be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though the relation between the diameter and circumference
cannot be accurately expressed in known numbers, it
may yet be approximated to any assigned degree of exactness.
And in this manner was the problem solved, about two thousand
years ago, by the great Archimedes, who discovered the
proportion to be nearly as seven to twenty-two. The process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>by which he effected this may be seen in his book <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Dimensione
Circuli</span></cite>. The same proportion was also discovered by
Philo Gadarensis and Apollonius Pergeus at a still earlier
period, as we are informed by Eutocius.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proportion of Vieta and Metius is that of one hundred
and thirteen to three hundred and fifty-five, which is a little
more exact than the former. It was derived from the pretended
quadrature of a M. Van Eick, which first gave rise to
the discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the first who ascertained this ratio to any great degree
of exactness was Van Ceulen, a Dutchman, in his book <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Circulo et Adscriptis</span></cite>. He found that if the diameter of a
circle was 1, the circumference would be 3·141592653589793238462643383279502884
nearly; which is exactly true to
thirty-six places of decimals, and was effected by the continual
bisection of an arc of a circle, a method so extremely troublesome
and laborious that it must have cost him incredible pains.
It is said to have been thought so curious a performance that
the numbers were cut on his tombstone in St. Peter’s churchyard,
at Leyden.</p>

<p class='c000'>But since the invention of fluxions, and the summation of
infinite series, several methods have been discovered for doing
the same thing with much more ease and expedition. Euler
and other eminent mathematicians have by these means given
a quadrature of the circle which is true to more than one hundred
places of decimals,—a proportion so extremely near the
truth that, unless the ratio could be completely obtained, we
need not wish for a greater degree of accuracy.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Prominent among the precocious mathematicians of the present
day is a colored boy in Kentucky, named William Marcy,
whose feats in mental arithmetic are truly wonderful. His
powers of computation appear to be fully equal to those of Bidder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Buxton, Grandimange, Colburn, or Safford. He can multiply
or divide millions by thousands in a few minutes from the
time the figures are given to him, and always with the utmost
exactness. Recently, in the presence of a party of gentlemen,
he added a column of figures, <i>eight</i> in a line, and <i>one hundred
and eighty</i> lines, making the sum total of several millions,
within <i>six minutes</i>. The feat was so astounding, and apparently
incredible, that several of the party took off their coats,
and, dividing the sum, went to work, and in two hours after
they commenced produced identically the same answers. The
boy is not quite seventeen years of age; he cannot read nor
write, and in every other branch of an English education is
entirely deficient. It is worthy of remark that mathematics
is the only department of science in which such feats of imbecile
minds can be achieved. The supposition would not, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a
priori</span></i>, be admissible; but frequent facts prove it. A negro,
a real idiot, was not long since reported in Alabama, who could
beat this Kentuckian in figures, but could scarcely do any thing
else worthy of a human intellect. Precocious mathematicians,
not imbecile, have usually turned out poorly; few of them, like
Pascal, have shown any general capacity. These facts suggest
inferences unfortunate for mathematical genius, if not for
mathematical studies. They have sublime relations, in their
“mixed” form, with our knowledge of the universe; but their
relations to genius—to human sentiments and sensibilities—to
the moral and ideal in humanity,—are, to say the least, quite
equivocal. The calculating power alone would seem to be the
least of human qualities, and to have the smallest amount of
reason in it; since a machine like Babbage’s can be made to
do the work of three or four calculators, and better than any
of them.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Lipsius made this offer to a German prince:—Sit here with
a poniard, and if in repeating <cite>Tacitus</cite> from beginning to end I
miss a single word, stab me. I will freely bare my breast for
you to strike.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>Muretus tells us of a young Corsican, a law-student at Padua,
who could, without hesitation, repeat thirty-six thousand Latin,
Greek, or barbarous words, significant or insignificant, upon once
hearing them. Muretus himself tested his wonderful memory,
and avers all alleged respecting it to be strictly true.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Carruthers, in the course of a lecture on Scottish history
mentioned an instance of Sir Walter Scott’s wonderful memory:
“I have heard Campbell relate how strongly Scott was impressed
with his (Campbell’s) poem of <cite>Lochiel’s Warning</cite>. ‘I
read it to him in manuscript,’ he said; ‘he then asked to read
it over himself, which he did slowly and distinctly, after which
he handed to me the manuscript, saying, ‘Take care of your
copyright, for I have got your poem by heart,’ and with only
these two readings he repeated the poem with scarcely a mistake.’
Certainly an extraordinary instance of memory, for the piece contains
eighty-eight lines. The subject, however, was one which
could not fail powerfully to arrest Scott’s attention, and versification
and diction are such as are easily caught up and remembered.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SILENT COMPLIMENT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>While an eloquent clergyman was addressing a religious
society, he intimated, more than once, that he was admonished to
conclude by the lateness of the hour. His discourse, however,
was so attractive that some ladies in the gallery covered the
clock with their shawls.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SELF-IMMOLATION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Comyn, Bishop of Durham, having quarrelled with his clergy,
they mixed poison with the wine of the Eucharist, and
gave it to him. He perceived the poison, but yet, with misguided
devotion, he drank it and died.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE NEED OF PROVIDENCE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Cecil says in his <cite>Remains</cite>:—We require the same hand to protect<a id='t434'></a>
us in apparent safety as in the most imminent and palpable
danger. One of the most wicked men in my neighborhood was
riding near a precipice and fell over: his horse was killed, but
he escaped without injury. Instead of thanking God for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>deliverance, he refused to acknowledge the hand of God in it,
but attributed his escape to chance. The same man was afterwards
riding on a very smooth road: his horse suddenly fell and
threw his rider over his head, and killed him on the spot, while
the horse escaped unhurt.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE COST OF SOLOMON’S TEMPLE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>According to the computation of Villalpandus, the talents of
gold, silver, and brass, used in the construction of the Temple,
amounted to £6,879,822,500. The jewels are reckoned to have
exceeded this sum; but, for the sake of an estimate, let their value
be set down at the same amount. The vessels of gold (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa
aurea</span></i>) consecrated to the use of the Temple are reckoned by Josephus
at 140,000 talents, which, according to Capel’s reduction,
are equal to £545,296,203. The vessels of silver (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa argentea</span></i>)
are computed at 1,340,000 talents, or £489,344,000. The silk
vestments of the priests cost £10,000; the purple vestments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>of the singers, £2,000,000. The trumpets amounted to
£200,000; other musical instruments to £40,000. To these
expenses must be added those of the other materials, the timber
and stone, and of the labor employed upon them, the labor
being divided thus: there were 10,000 men engaged at Lebanon
in hewing timber (<i>silvicidæ</i>); there were 70,000 bearers of
burdens (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectores</span></i>); 20,000 hewers of stone (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapicidinæ</span></i>); and
3,300 overseers (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">episcopi</span></i>); all of whom were employed for
seven years, and upon whom, besides their wages and diet,
Solomon bestowed £6,733,977 (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">donum Solomonis</span></i>). If the
daily food and wages of each man be estimated at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, the
sum total will be £93,877,088. The costly stone and the timber
in the rough may be set down as at least equal to one-third
of the gold, or about £2,545,296,000. The several estimates
will then amount to £17,442,442,268, or $77,521,965,636.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE NUMBER SEVEN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the year 1502 there was printed at Leipsic a work entitled

number seven. It consists of seven parts, each consisting of
seven divisions. In 1624 appeared in London a curious work
on the subject of numbers, bearing the following title: <cite>The
Secrets of Numbers, according to Theological, Arithmetical,
Geometrical, and Harmonical Computation; drawn, for the
better part, out of those Ancients, as well as Neoteriques.
Pleasing to read, profitable to understand, opening themselves
to the capacities of both learned and unlearned; being no
other than a key to lead men to any doctrinal knowledge whatsoever</cite>.
In the ninth chapter the author has given many notable
opinions from learned men, to prove the excellency of the
number <i>seven</i>. “First, it neither begets nor is begotten, according
to the saying of Philo. Some numbers, indeed, within the
compass of ten, beget, but are not begotten; and that is the
unarie. Others are begotten, but beget not; as the octonarie.
Only the septenarie, having a prerogative above them all, neither
begetteth nor is begotten. This is its first divinity or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>perfection. Secondly, this is a harmonical number, and the
well and fountain of that fair and lovely <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Digamma</span></i>, because it
includeth within itself all manner of harmony. Thirdly, it is
a theological number, consisting of perfection. Fourthly, because
of its compositure; for it is compounded of the first two
perfect numbers equal and unequal,—three and four; for the
number two, consisting of repeated unity, which is no number,
is not perfect. Now, every one of these being excellent of
themselves, (as hath been demonstrated,) how can this number
be but far more excellent, consisting of them all, and participating,
as it were, of all their excellent virtues?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hippocrates says that the septenary number by its occult
virtue tends to the accomplishment of all things, is the dispenser
of life and fountain of all its changes; and, like Shakspeare,
he divides the life of man into seven ages. In seven
months a child may be born and live, and not before. Anciently
a child was not named before seven days, not being accounted
fully to have life before that periodical day. The teeth
spring out in the seventh month, and are renewed in the
seventh year, when infancy is changed into childhood. At
thrice seven years the faculties are developed, manhood commences,
and we become legally competent to all civil acts; at
four times seven man is in the full possession of his strength;
at five times seven he is fit for the business of the world; at six
times seven he becomes grave and wise, or never; at seven
times seven he is in his apogee, and from that time he decays.
At eight times seven he is in his first climacteric; at nine
times seven, or sixty-three, he is in his grand climacteric, or
year of danger; and ten times seven, or threescore years and
ten, has, by the Royal Prophet, been pronounced the natural
period of human life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In six days creation was perfected, and the seventh was consecrated
to rest. On the seventh of the seventh month a holy
observance was ordained to the children of Israel, who feasted
seven days and remained seven days in rest; the seventh year
was directed to be a sabbath of rest for all things; and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>end of seven times seven years commenced the grand Jubilee;
every seventh year the land lay fallow; every seventh year
there was a general release from all debts, and all bondsmen
were set free. From this law may have originated the custom
of binding young men to seven years’ apprenticeship, and of
punishing incorrigible offenders by transportation for seven,
twice seven, or three times seven years. Every seventh year
the law was directed to be read to the people; Jacob served
seven years for the possession of Rachel, and also another
seven years. Noah had seven days’ warning of the flood, and
was commanded to take the fowls of the air into the ark by
sevens, and the clean beasts by sevens. The ark touched the
ground on the seventh month; and in seven days a dove was
sent, and again in seven days after. The seven years of plenty
and seven years of famine were foretold in Pharaoh’s dreams by
the seven fat and the seven lean beasts, and the seven ears of
full corn and the seven ears of blasted corn. The young animals
were to remain with the dam seven days, and at the close
of the seventh taken away. By the old law, man was commanded
to forgive his offending brother seven times; but the
meekness of the last revealed religion extended his humility
and forbearance to seventy times seven times. “If Cain shall
be revenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy times seven.” In
the destruction of Jericho, seven priests bore seven trumpets
seven days, and on the seventh day surrounded the walls seven
times, and after the seventh time the walls fell. Balaam prepared
seven bullocks and seven rams for a sacrifice; Laban
pursued Jacob seven days’ journey; Job’s friends sat with him
seven days and seven nights, and offered seven bullocks and
seven rams as an atonement for their wickedness; David, in
bringing up the ark, offered seven bullocks and seven rams;
Elijah sent his servant seven times to look for the cloud;
Hezekiah, in cleansing the temple, offered seven bullocks and
seven rams and seven he-goats for a sin-offering. The children
of Israel, when Hezekiah took away the strange altars, kept
the feast of unleavened bread seven days, and then again another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>seven days. King Ahasuerus had seven chamberlains,
a seven days’ feast, and sent for the queen on the seventh day;
and in the seventh year of his reign she was taken to him.
Queen Esther had seven maids to attend her. Solomon was
seven years building the temple, at the dedication of which he
feasted seven days; in the tabernacle were seven lamps; seven
days were appointed for an atonement upon the altar, and the
priest’s son was ordained to wear his father’s garment seven
days; the children of Israel ate unleavened bread seven days;
Abraham gave seven ewe-lambs to Abimelech as a memorial
for a well; Joseph mourned seven days for Jacob. The rabbins
say God employed the power of answering this number to
perfect the greatness of Samuel, his name answering the value
of the letters in the Hebrew word, which signifies seven,—whence
Hannah, his mother, in her thanks, says “that the
barren had brought forth the seventh.” In Scripture are enumerated
seven resurrections,—the widow’s son, by Elias; the
Shunamite’s son, by Elisha; the soldier who touched the bone
of the prophet; the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue;
the widow’s son of Nain; Lazarus, and our blessed Lord. Out
of Mary Magdalene were cast seven devils. The apostles chose
seven deacons. Enoch, who was translated, was the seventh
after Adam, and Jesus Christ the seventy-seventh in a direct
line. Our Saviour spoke seven times from the cross, on which
he remained seven hours; he appeared seven times; after seven
times seven days he sent the Holy Ghost. In the Lord’s Prayer
are seven petitions, expressed in seven times seven words, omitting
those of mere grammatical connection. Within this number
are contained all the mysteries of the Apocalypse revealed
to the seven churches of Asia; there appeared seven golden
candlesticks and seven stars that were in the hand of Him that
was in the midst; seven lamps, being the seven spirits of God;
the book with seven seals; seven kings; seven thunders;
seven thousand men slain; the dragon with seven heads, and
the seven angels bearing seven vials of wrath; the vision of
Daniel seventy weeks. The fiery furnace was made seven times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>hotter for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; Nebuchadnezzar
ate the grass of the field seven years. The elders of Israel
were seventy. There are also numbered seven heavens, seven
planets, seven stars, seven wise men, seven champions of Christendom,
seven notes in music, seven primary colors, seven
deadly sins, seven sacraments in the Roman Catholic Church,
and seven wonders of the world. The seventh son was considered
as endowed with pre-eminent wisdom; the seventh son
of a seventh son is still thought by some to possess the power
of healing diseases spontaneously. Perfection is likened to
gold seven times purified in the fire; and we yet say, “you
frighten me out of my seven senses.” There were seven chiefs
before Thebes. The blood was to be sprinkled seven times before
the altar; Naaman was to be dipped seven times in Jordan;
Apuleius speaks of the dipping of the head seven times
in the sea for purification. In all solemn rites of purgation,
dedication, and consecration, the oil or water was seven times
sprinkled. The house of wisdom, in Proverbs, had seven
pillars.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE NUMBER THREE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When the world was created, we find land, water, and sky;
sun, moon, and stars. Noah had but three sons; Jonah was
three days in the whale’s belly; our Saviour passed three days
in the tomb. Peter denied his Saviour thrice. There were
three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham entertained
three angels. Samuel was called three times. “Simon,
lovest thou me?” was repeated three times. Daniel was thrown
into a den with three lions, for praying three times a day.
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were rescued from the
flames of the oven. The Commandments were delivered on the
third day. Job had three friends. St. Paul speaks of faith,
hope, and charity, these three. Those famous dreams of the
baker and butler were to come to pass in three days; and
Elijah prostrated himself three times on the body of the dead
child. Samson deceived Delilah three times before she discovered
the source of his strength. In mythology there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>three graces; Cerberus with his three heads; Neptune holding
his three-toothed staff; the Oracle of Delphi cherished with
veneration the tripod; and the nine Muses sprang from three.
The witches in Macbeth ask, “When shall we three meet
again?” The Pope’s tiara is triple. We have morning, noon,
and night; fish, flesh, and fowl; water, ice, and snow. Trees
group their leaves in threes; there is three-leaved clover.
What could be done in mathematics without the aid of the
triangle? witness the power of the wedge; and in logic three
propositions are indispensable. It is a common phrase that
“three is a lucky number.” Life stands on a tripod, the feet
of which are the circulation, respiration, and innervation; death
is therefore the result of a failure in the heart, the lungs, or the
brain. Finally, there is earth, heaven, and hell; and above
all, the Holy Trinity.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE NUMBER NINE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The singular properties of the number nine are well known
to arithmeticians. The following is one of the most interesting.
If the cardinal numbers from 1 to 9 inclusive, omitting 8, be
used as a multiplicand, and any one of them multiplied by 9 be
used as a multiplier, the result will present a succession of
figures the same as that multiplied by the 9. For example, if
we wish a series of fives, we take 5 times 9, equal to 45, for
a multiplier:—</p>

<div class='box fixed'>
      <div class='right'>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9</div>
      <div class='right'>4 5</div>
      <hr />
      <div class='right'>6 1 7 2 8 3 9 5</div>
      <div class='left'>4 9 3 8 2 7 1 6</div>
      <hr />
      <div class='right'>5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A similar result will be obtained by using all the other numbers,
including 8 (72); but the 8 must in all cases be omitted
in the multiplicand.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHANGES OF THE KALEIDOSCOPE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following curious calculation has been made of the number
of changes which this wonderful instrument will admit:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>Supposing the instrument to contain twenty small pieces of
glass, &amp;c., and that you make ten changes in each minute, it
will take the inconceivable space of 462,880,899,576 years and
360 days to go through the immense variety of changes it is
capable of producing,—amounting (according to our frail idea
of the nature of things) to an eternity, Or, if you take only
twelve small pieces, and make ten changes in each minute, it
will then take 33,264 days, or 91 years and 49 days, to exhaust
its variations. However exaggerated this statement may appear
to some, it is actually the case.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NOAH’S ARK AND THE GREAT EASTERN STEAMSHIP.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following comparison between the size of Noah’s Ark
and the Leviathan (Great Eastern), both being considered in
point of tonnage, after the old law for calculating the tonnage,
exhibits a remarkable similarity. The sacred cubit, as stated
by Sir Isaac Newton, is 20·625 English inches; by Bishop
Wilkins at 21·88 inches. According to these authorities, the
dimensions will be as follows:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DIVERSITY OF COLORS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In a very amusing work of the celebrated Goethe, entitled
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Winkelmann und sein Jahrhundert</span></cite>, it is stated that about
fifteen thousand varieties of color are employed by the workers
of mosaic in Rome, and that there are fifty shades of each of
these varieties, from the deepest to the palest, thus affording
seven hundred and fifty thousand tints, which the artist can
distinguish with the greatest facility. It might be imagined
that with the command of seven hundred and fifty thousand
tints of colors, the most varied and beautiful painting could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>perfectly imitated; yet this is not the case, for the mosaic-workers
find a lack of tints, even amid this astonishing
variety.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AEROLITES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Meteoric stones, in single masses and in showers, have fallen
from the atmosphere at various, and in many cases uncertain,
periods, throughout the world. The largest of these at present
known is in the province of Tucuman, in South America, in
the midst of an extensive plain. It weighs thirty thousand
pounds. A mass in the Imperial Cabinet in Vienna was brought
from Agram, in Croatia, where it fell in 1751. It was seen by
the inhabitants while falling from the air, and is said to have
appeared like a globe of fire. Professor Pallas, in his travels
in Siberia, found a mass on the mountains of Kemir, weighing
sixteen hundred and eighty pounds, which the inhabitants
told him fell from the sky. About one hundred and
fifty miles from Bahia, in Brazil, is a mass of a crystalline texture
weighing fourteen thousand pounds. There are also large
masses in West Greenland, Mexico, Peru, and South Africa.
The specimen in the cabinet at New Haven, weighing three
thousand pounds, was brought from Red River in Louisiana.
Showers of meteorolites, weighing from a few ounces to twenty
pounds, are recorded by observers as having fallen at Ensisheim,
in 1492; at Mort, in 1750; at Aire, in 1769; at Juliac, in
1790; at Sienna, in 1794; at Benares, in 1798; at L’Aigle,
in 1803; and at St. Germaine, in 1808. One of the most remarkable
instances that has occurred in this country under the
direct observation of eye-witnesses took place in Fairfield
county, Connecticut, in December, 1807, an interesting account
of which may be found in vol. vi. American Philosophical
Transactions (1809). A similar occurrence happened at Norwich,
in the same State, in 1836.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the extraordinary origin of these aerolites, or
meteorolites, it has been incontestably proved to be atmospheric,
by eye-witnesses, by the similarity of their composition in
all cases, by the fact that though the materials thus mingled—being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>chiefly native iron, with small proportions of nickel,
silex, aluminium, magnesium, and sulphur—are well known, they
are never united in the same manner among the productions of
the globe; and further, by the fact that they are never projected
from terrestrial volcanoes, and that the situations in which
they are found are generally isolated and always on the surface
of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It remains, then, for the philosopher to ascertain the source of
this interesting portion of nature. The great difficulty of this
task is evident from the number and variety of the theories
which have been formed respecting it, and their liability to
serious objections. Those who hold the opinion that aerolites
are formed from substances floating in the atmosphere must
resort to the hypothesis that iron, nickel, silex, sulphur, &amp;c.
are first rendered volatile, and then synthetically formed
into the ponderous stones which fall from above. Professor
Silliman remarks of this recourse to atmospheric formation
from gaseous ingredients, that it is a crude, unphilosophical
conception, inconsistent with known chemical facts, and
physically impossible. The theory which refers these aerolites
to <i>lunar</i> volcanic origin seems to have more to recommend it.
La Place, the illustrious author of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mécanique Céleste</span></cite>,—the
respect due to whose opinion no one will dispute,—maintained
that these meteoric stones are expelled violently from the active
volcanoes which telescopic research has proved to exist in great
numbers on the surface of the moon, and that, passing beyond
the limits of the attraction of our satellite, they come within the
influence of the earth and are drawn towards its surface. It
has been calculated that the power required to drive a body
beyond the moon’s attraction would be only about four times
that with which a ball is expelled from a cannon with the ordinary
charge of gunpowder. However rapid a velocity of seven
thousand seven hundred and seventy feet per second may seem,
it would not require an improbable amount of mechanical
force.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Olmsted, the American astronomer, has offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>the most satisfactory explanation. He has shown that countless
bodies, of comparatively small dimensions, cluster together
in vast rings, and revolve, as do the planets, around the sun;
that these bodies become visible when the orbit of the earth
approaches their orbit; that sometimes they are entangled in
our atmosphere, catch fire from their enormous velocity, and
fall to the earth as meteoric stones. In this way the shooting
stars and meteors are shown to be diminutive planets, which
in composition and orbital motion resemble our own earth, and
almost fill the planetary space with their countless squadrons.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FATE OF AMERICA’S DISCOVERERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is remarkable how few of the eminent men of the discoverers
and conquerors of the New World died in peace.
Columbus died broken-hearted; Roldin and Bobadilla were
drowned; Ovando was harshly superseded; Las Casas sought
refuge in a cowl; Ojeda died in extreme poverty; Enciso was
deposed by his own men; Nicuessa perished miserably by the
cruelty of his party; Vasco Nunez de Balboa was disgracefully
beheaded; Narvaez was imprisoned in a tropical dungeon, and
afterwards died of hardship; Cortez was dishonored; Alvarado
was destroyed in ambush; Almagro was garroted; Pizarro was
murdered, and his four brothers cut off; and there was no end
to the assassinations and executions of the secondary chiefs
among the energetic and daring adventurers.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FACTS ABOUT THE PRESIDENTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of the first seven Presidents of the United States, four were
from Virginia, two of the same name from Massachusetts, and
one from Tennessee. All but one were sixty-six years old on
leaving office, having served two terms, and one of those who
served but one term would have been sixty-six years of age at
the end of another. Three of the seven died on the 4th of
July, and two of them on the same day and year. Two of them
were on the sub-committee of three that drafted the Declaration
of Independence; and these two died on the same day and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>year, on the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence,
and just half a century from the day of the Declaration. The
names of three of the seven end in son, yet none of them transmitted
his name to a <i>son</i>. The initials of the names of two of
the seven are the same; the initials of two others are the
same; and those of still two others, the same. The remaining
one, who stands alone in this particular, stands also alone in the
love and admiration of his countrymen and of the civilized
world,—Washington. Of the first five, only one had a son, and
that son was also President. Neither of the Presidents who
had sons were elected for a second term.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CROWN OF ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The crown of England is a costly “bauble,” bedazzled with
jewels enough to found three or four public charities, or a half-dozen
ordinary colleges. There are twenty diamonds round
the circle, worth $7,500 each, making $150,000; two large
centre diamonds, $10,000 each, making $20,000; fifty-four
smaller diamonds, placed at the angle of the former, each
$500; four crosses, each composed of twenty-five diamonds,
$60,000; four large diamonds on the top of the crosses,
$20,000; twelve diamonds contained in the fleur-de-lis, $50,000;
eighteen smaller diamonds contained in the same, $10,000;
pearls, diamonds, &amp;c. upon the arches and crosses, $50,000;
also one hundred and forty-one small diamonds, $25,000;
twenty-six diamonds in the upper cross, $15,500; two circles
of pearls about the rim, $15,000. The cost of the stones in
the crown, exclusive of the metal, is, therefore, nearly half a
million of dollars.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AN ARMY OF WOMEN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the army of the Chinese rebels, there were in 1853, in
Nanking alone, about half a million of women, collected from
various parts of the country and formed into brigades of thirteen
thousand, under female officers. Of these, ten thousand
were picked women, drilled and garrisoned in the city; the rest
were compelled to undergo the drudgery of digging moats,
making earth works, erecting batteries, &amp;c.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>THE STAR IN THE EAST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Under the influence of a conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn, and
Mars, which took place in the year 1604, Kepler was led to
think that he had discovered means for determining the true
year of our Saviour’s birth. He made his calculations, and
found that Jupiter and Saturn were in conjunction in the constellation
of the Fishes (a fish is the astrological symbol of
Judæa) in the latter half of the year of Rome 747, and were
joined by Mars in 748. Here then he fixed the first figure in
the date of our era, and here he found the appearance in the
heavens which induced the magi to undertake their journey, and
conducted them successfully on their way. Others have taken
up this view, freed it from astrological impurities, and shown
its trustworthiness and applicability in the case under consideration.
It appears that Jupiter and Saturn came together for
the first time on May 20th in the twentieth degree of the constellation
of the Fishes. They then stood before sunrise in the
eastern part of the heavens, and so were seen by the magi.
Jupiter then passed by Saturn towards the north. About the
middle of September they were near midnight both in opposition
to the sun, Saturn in the thirteenth, Jupiter in the fifteenth degree,
being distant from each other about a degree and a half.
They then drew nearer: on October 27th there was a second conjunction
in the sixteenth degree, and on November 12th there
took place a third conjunction in the fifteenth degree of the same
constellation. In the last two conjunctions the interval between
the planets amounted to no more than a degree, so that to the
unassisted eye the rays of the one planet were absorbed in those
of the other, and the two bodies would appear as one. The two
planets went past each other three times, came very near together,
and showed themselves all night long for months in conjunction
with each other, as if they would never separate again. Their
first union in the east awoke the attention of the magi, told
them the expected time had come, and bade them set off without
delay towards Judæa (the fish land). When they reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>Jerusalem the two planets were once more blended together.
Then, in the evening, they stood in the southern part of the sky,
pointing with their united rays to Bethlehem, where prophecy
declared the Messiah was to be born. The magi followed the
finger of heavenly light, and were brought to the child Jesus.
The conclusion in regard to the time of the advent is that our
Lord was born in the latter part of the year of Rome 747, or
six years before the common era.</p>

<p class='c000'>A recent writer of considerable merit, Wieseler (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chronolog.
Synop. der 4 Evangelien.</span></cite>) has applied this theory of Kepler in
conjunction with a discovery that he has made from some
Chinese astronomical tables, which show that in the year of
Rome 750 a comet appeared in the heavens, and was visible for
seventy days. Wieseler’s opinion is that the conjunction of
the planets excited and fixed the attention of the magi, but that
their guiding-star was the aforesaid comet.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DIPLOMATIC COSTUME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Franklin, it is well known, gained great praise for wearing
an ordinary plain suit, instead of a gold embroidered Court
costume, when formally presented to King Louis XVI. In
reference to this anecdote, Nathaniel Hawthorne, in his notebook
states that he was told by an aged lady, in England, that
the circumstance above mentioned arose from the fact that
Franklin’s tailor disappointed him of his Court suit, and that he
wore his plain one with great reluctance, because he had no
other. Franklin, it is said, having by his mishap made a successful
impression, continued to wear his plain dress through
policy. Thus we have another dissipation of one of those
pleasant fictions which have been transmitted by the historian
and the painter. It is like the apocryphal story of Franklin
reading the prayer of Habakkuk to an assembly of French
infidels, who are said to have pronounced it one of the finest
compositions they had ever heard, and to have eagerly inquired
where it might be found.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE LONGEVITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of
strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow;
for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.—Psalm xc. 10.</p>

<p class='c000'>Haller has noted one thousand cases of centenarians: sixty-two
of from 110 to 120 years; twenty-nine of from 120 to 130;
and fifteen who had attained from 130 to 140 years. Beyond
this advanced age, well-authenticated examples of longevity are
very rare. The case of Henry Jenkins, the Yorkshire fisherman,
who died in December, 1670, at the age of 169, is one of
the most remarkable. He is buried in the church of Bolton-upon-Swale,
where may be found a long inscription, chiefly referring
to his humble position in life and his patriarchal age.
That of Thomas Parr is also well known. He was first married
at the age of 80, and afterwards at 122, and died in 1635, aged
152. He was a farmer, and up to the age of 130 was able to
dig, plough, and thrash. Had he continued his simple and abstemious
habits, his life would probably have been prolonged a
considerable period; but the luxurious living of the court of
Charles I., at which his latter years were spent, occasioned a
plethoric condition which hastened his end. The famous Harvey
dissected him after death, and found no appearance of
decay in any organ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following list of instances of very advanced age is

<p class='c000'>Czartan’s biographer says of him:—He was born in the year
1539 and died January 5th, 1724, at Kofrosch, a village four
miles from Temeswar. A few days before his death, being
nearly 185 years old, he had walked, with the help of a stick,
to the post-house at Kofrosch, to ask charity from the travellers.
His eyes were much inflamed; but he still enjoyed a little sight.
His hair and beard were of a greenish white color, like mouldy
bread; and he had a few of his teeth remaining. His son, who
was 97 years of age, declared that his father had once been a
head taller; that at a great age he married for the third time,
and that he was born in this last marriage. He was accustomed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>agreeably to the rules of his religion, (Greek Church,)
to observe fast-days with great strictness, and never to use any
other food than milk, and certain cakes, called by the Hungarians
<i><span lang="hu" xml:lang="hu">collatschen</span></i>, together with a good glass of brandy such
as is made in the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hungarian family of Roven affords an extraordinary example
of long life. The father attained the age of 172, the
wife, 164; they had been married 142 years, and their youngest
child was 115; and such was the influence of habit and filial
affection that this <i>child</i> was treated with all the severity of
parental rigidity, and did not dare to act without his <i>papa’s</i>
and <i>mamma’s</i> permission.</p>

<p class='c000'>Examples of great longevity are frequent in Russia. According
to an official report, there were, in 1828, in the empire, 828
centenarians, of whom forty had exceeded 120 years; fifteen,
130; nine, 136; and three, 138 years. In the government of
Moscow there died, in 1830, a man aged 150. In the government
of Kieff, an old soldier died in 1844, at the age of 153.
There lately died on an estate in the government of Viatka, a
peasant named Michael Kniawelkis, who had attained the age
of 137 years, 10 months, and 11 days. He was born in a village
of the same district, married at the age of 19, and had had,
by several wives, 32 children, one of whom, a daughter, is still
living, at the age of 100. He never had any serious illness;
some years before his death he complained that he could not
read without glasses, but to the last day he retained the use of
all his faculties, and was very cheerful. He frequently said
that he thought death had forgotten him.</p>

<p class='c000'>In China, on the contrary, such instances are rare. From a
census made a few years ago, we learn that out of a population
of 369,000,000 there were but four centenarians.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to the census of the United States, taken in 1830,
there were 2,556 persons a hundred years old, or upwards.
The census of 1850 exhibits nearly the same number. This
gives one centenarian to a population of 9,000. From this
census we also learn that the oldest person then living in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>United States was 140. This was an Indian woman residing
in North Carolina. In the same State was an Indian aged 125,
a negro woman 111, two black slaves 110 each, one mulatto
male 120, and several white males and females from 106 to
114. In the parish of Lafayette, La., was a female, black,
aged 120. In several of the States there were found persons,
white and black, aged from 110 to 115.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is now living in Murray county, Georgia, on the waters
of Holy Creek, a Revolutionary veteran, who has attained the
age of 135. His name is John Hames. He is known throughout
the region in which he lives by the appellative, “Gran’sir
Hames.” He was born in Mecklenburg county, Virginia, and
was a lad 10 years old when Washington was in his cradle.
He was 32 when Braddock met his disastrous defeat on the
Monongahela. He, with a number of his neighbors, set forth
to join the ill-fated commander, but after several days’ march
were turned back by the news of his overthrow. He migrated
to South Carolina nearly 100 years ago. He was in thirteen
considerable conflicts during the war of Independence, and in
skirmishes and encounters with Indians, with tories, and with
British, times beyond memory. He was with Gates at Camden,
with Morgan at Cowpens, with Green at Hillsboro’ and Eutaw,
and with Marion in many a bold rush into a tory camp or redcoat
quarters.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time of the Eighth Census there were about 20,000
persons in the United States who were living when the Declaration
of Independence was signed in 1776. They must
necessarily have been more than eighty years old, in order to
have lived at that time. The French Census of 1851 shows
only 102 persons over 100 years old,—though the total
population was nearly 36,000,000. Old age is therefore attained
among us much more frequently than in France.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Cordova, in South America, in the year of 1780, a judicial
inquiry was instituted by the authorities to determine the age
of a negress by the name of Louisa Truxo. She testified that
she perfectly remembered Fernando Truxo, the bishop, who gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>her as his contribution toward a university fund: he died in
1614. Another negress, who was known to be 120, testified
that Louisa was an elderly woman when she was a child. On
this evidence the authorities of Cordova concluded that Louisa
was, as she asserted, 175 years old.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two cases are recorded by Mr. Bailey, in his <cite>Annals of Longevity</cite>,
which throw all these into the shade; but the evidence
furnished is inadequate and unsatisfactory. One is that of an
Englishman, Thomas Cam, whom the parish register of Shoreditch
affirms to have died in 1588, at the age of 207, having
paid allegiance to twelve monarchs. The other is that of a
Russian,—name not given,—whom the St. Petersburg Gazette
mentioned as having died in 1812, at an age exceeding 200.</p>

register of burials of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MEANS OF RECOGNITION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When the English suite of Lord Macartney was invited to a
grand entertainment in China, one of them, understanding that
it was not expedient to venture upon every dish which appeared
under the guise of the native cookery, was desirous of ascertaining
how far he might venture with safety, and as the Chinese
waiters could understand a little English, he pointed to a dish
before him, and said to the attendant in an interrogative tone,
“Quack-quack?” meaning to inquire if it was a duck. The attendant
perfectly understood him, and immediately replied, with
great solemnity and sincerity, “Bow-wow!”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Rossini once unexpectedly met his old friend Sir Henry
Bishop, but having at the moment forgotten his name, after
puzzling and stammering for some time, he at length took him
by the hand, and sang a few bars to prove he identified him
through Bishop’s beautiful song, “Blow gentle gales.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>MARRIAGE VOW.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The matrimonial ceremony, like many others, has undergone
some variation in the progress of time. Upwards of three
centuries ago, the husband, on taking his wife by the right
hand, thus addressed her; “I, A. B., <i>undersygne</i> thee, C. D.,
for my wedded wyfe, for beter, for worse, for richer, for porer,
yn sekness, and in helthe, tyl dethe us departe, [not “do
part,” as now erroneously rendered, <i>departe</i> formerly meaning
to <i>separate</i>,] as holy churche hath ordeyned, and thereto I
plyght thee my trowthe.” The wife replied in the same form,
with an additional clause, “to be buxum to thee, tyl dethe
us departe.” So it appears in the first edition of the <cite>Missals
for the use of the famous and celebrated Church of Hereford</cite>,
1502. In the <cite>Salisbury Missal</cite>, the lady promised “to be
bonere [debonnair] and buxum in bedde and at the borde.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>COMPOSITION IN DREAMS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Condorcet is said to have attained the conclusion of some
of his most abstruse unfinished calculations in his dreams.
Franklin makes a similar admission concerning some of his
political projects, which in his waking moments sorely puzzled
him. Herschel composed the following lines in a dream:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Throw thyself on thy God, nor mock him with feeble denial;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Sure of his love, and, oh! sure of his mercy at last;</div>
      <div class='line'>Bitter and deep though the draught, yet drain thou the cup of thy trial,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And, in its healing effect, smile at the bitterness past.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Goethe says in his <cite>Memoirs</cite>, “The objects which had occupied
my attention during the day often reappeared at night in connected
dreams. On awakening, a new composition, or a portion
of one I had already commenced, presented itself to my mind.”
Coleridge composed his poem of the <cite>Abyssinian Maid</cite> during
a dream. Cockburn says of Lord Jeffrey:—“He had a fancy
that though he went to bed with his head stuffed with the
names, dates, and other details of various causes, they were all
in order in the morning; which he accounted for by saying that
during sleep they all crystallized round their proper centres.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>FACTS ABOUT SLEEP.</h3>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Come sleep, O sleep! the certain knot of peace,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe;</div>
      <div class='line'>The poor man’s wealth, the prisoner’s release,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The impartial judge between the high and low.</div>
      <div class='line in38'><span class='sc'>Sir Philip Sidney.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>While I am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, neither trouble nor glory,
and blessings on him who invented sleep, the mantle that covers all human
thoughts; the food that appeases hunger; the drink that quenches thirst; the
fire that warms cold; the cold that moderates heat; and lastly, the general
coin that purchases all things; the balance and weight that makes the shepherd
equal to the king, and the simple to the wise.—<cite>Sancho Panza.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Philip Sidney calls sleep “the poor man’s wealth,” and,
he might have added, it is every man’s health. Men have
often, according to their own notions, attempted to limit or extend
the hours of sleep. Thus, the “immortal Alfred” of England
divided the day into three portions of eight hours each,
assigning one for refreshment and the health of the body by
sleep, diet, and exercise, another for business, and the third for
study and devotion. Bishop Taylor considered three hours’, and
Richard Baxter four hours’, sleep sufficient for any man.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Nature requires five,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Custom gives seven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laziness takes nine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And wickedness eleven.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The error into which these and others have fallen arises not
only from the fact that in this, as well as in other things, every
man is a law to himself, but from the varying amount required
in each individual case at different times, depending upon the
amount of renovation required by the nervous and muscular
systems. John Wesley, the distinguished founder of Methodism,
who attained the age of eighty-eight, and who could command
sleep on horseback, says very properly, in some curious remarks
which he has left upon sleep, that no one measure will
do for all, nor will the same amount of sleep suffice even for
the same person at all times. A person debilitated by sickness
requires more of “tired nature’s sweet restorer” than one in
vigorous health. More sleep is also necessary when the strength
and spirits are exhausted by hard labor or severe mental efforts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>Whatever may be the case with some few persons, of a peculiar
constitution, it is evident that health and vigor can scarcely be
expected to continue long without six hours’ sleep in the four-and-twenty.
Wesley adds that during his long life he never
knew any individual who retained vigorous health for a whole
year, with a less quantity of sleep than this.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that women, in general, require more sleep than
men. This is doubtful: it is certain, at least, that women endure
protracted wakefulness better than men. The degree of
muscular and mental exertion to which the male is accustomed
would seem to indicate that a longer period of rest ought to be
required by him to admit of the necessary restoration of excitability.
In infancy and youth, where the animal functions are
extremely active, the necessity for sleep is greatest; in mature
age, where time is more valued and cares are more numerous,
it is less indulged; whilst the aged may be affected in two opposite
ways; they may be either in a state of almost constant
somnolency, or their sleep may be short and light.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some remarkable cases on record of deviations
from the customary amount of sleep, making a “bed shorter
than for an ordinary man to stretch himself upon, and a covering
narrower than he can wrap himself in,” capacious enough
for persons of very active habits in their waking hours. Many
persons have reached advanced age without ever having had
more than one or two hours’ sleep out of the twenty-four.
There is one case of a man who, throughout his whole life, never
slept more than fifteen minutes at one time. General Pichegru
informed Sir Gilbert Blane that, in the course of his active campaigns,
he had for a whole year not more than one hour of sleep
in the twenty-four hours. Frederick of Prussia and Napoleon,
as a general thing, only devoted three or four hours to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>One can scarcely conceive a more horrible mode of torture
than the Chinese plan of condemning criminals to death by preventing
sleep. The victim is kept awake by guards alternately
stationed for the purpose. His sufferings last from twelve to
twenty days, when death comes to his relief.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>The influence of habit in promoting or preventing sleep is
remarkable. Those accustomed to the tranquillity of rural districts
are excessively annoyed by the din of the carriages on
the paved thoroughfares of a large city. It is said, on the
other hand, that those who live near the cataracts of the Nile
cannot sleep at a distance from them, owing to their having
become accustomed to the noise, the stimulus of which upon
the ear they lack. Some persons can only sleep in the dark;
we knew a woman who slept habitually with a candle burning
in her bedroom, and who invariably awoke if the light went
out. Some of the soldiers of Bonaparte’s army would sleep,
after extreme fatigue and exhaustion, on the ground by the
side of a twenty-four pounder which was constantly firing.
Some boys slept from fatigue on board of Nelson’s ship, at the
battle of the Nile. We have heard of a boiler-maker who
could go to sleep in a boiler while the workmen were constantly
hammering the rivets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sleep can persist with the exercise of certain muscles. Couriers
on long journeys nap on horseback; and coachmen, on
their boxes. Among the impressive incidents of Sir John
Moore’s disastrous retreat to Corunna, in Spain, not the least
striking is the recorded fact that many of his soldiers steadily
pursued their march while fast asleep. Burdach, however,
affirms that this is not uncommon among soldiers. Franklin
slept nearly an hour swimming on his back. An acquaintance
of Dr. D., travelling with a party in North Carolina, being
greatly fatigued, was observed to be sound asleep in his saddle.
His horse, being a better walker, went far in advance of the
rest. On crossing a hill, they found him on the ground,
snoring gently. His horse had fallen, as was evident from his
bruised knees, and had thrown his rider on his head on a hard
surface, without waking him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Animals of the lower orders obey peculiar laws in regard to
sleep. Fish are said to sleep soundly; and we are told by
Aristotle that the tench may be taken in this state, if approached
cautiously. Many birds and beasts of prey take their
repose in the daytime. When kept in captivity, this habit undergoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>a change,—which makes us doubt whether it was not
the result of necessity, which demanded that they should take
advantage of the darkness, silence, and the unguarded state of
their victims. In the menagerie at Paris, even the hyena
sleeps at night, and is awake by day. They all, however, seek,
as favoring the purpose, a certain degree of seclusion and shade,
with the exception of the lion, who, Burdach informs us, sleeps
at noonday, in the open plain; and the eagle and condor will
poise themselves on the most elevated pinnacle of rock, in the
clear blue atmosphere and dazzling sunlight. Birds, however, are
furnished with a winking membrane, generally, to shelter the eye
from light. Fish prefer to retire to sleep under the shadow of a
rock or a woody bank. Of domestic animals, the horse seems to
require least sleep; and that he usually takes in the erect posture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Birds that roost in a sitting posture are furnished with a
well-adapted mechanism, which keeps them firmly supported
without voluntary or conscious action. The tendon of the claws
is so arranged as to be tightened by their weight when the thighs
are bent, thus contracting closely and grasping the bough or
perch. In certain other animals which sleep erect, the articulations
of the foot and knee are described by Dumeril as resembling
the spring of a pocket-knife, which opens the instrument
and serves to keep the blade in a line with the handle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following calculation is interesting. Suppose one boy
aged ten years determines to rise at five o’clock all the year
round. Another of the same age, indolent and fond of ease,
rises at eight, or an average of eight, every morning. If they
both live to be seventy years old, the one will have gained over
the other, during the intervening period of sixty years, sixty-five
thousand seven hundred and forty-five hours, which is equal
to two thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine and a third days,
or just seven and a half years. If a similar calculation were
applied to the whole country, how many millions of years of
individual usefulness would it prove to be lost to society!</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>OPIUM AND EAST INDIAN HEMP.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is nothing in nature more curious and inexplicable
than the influence on the circulating fluids, and through these on
the brain and its functions, of various narcotic drugs. Among
these, opium, and <i>Cannabis Indica</i>, or East Indian hemp,
occupy the most prominent place. No reflective person can
look into the writings of Coleridge, De Quincey, or Bayard
Taylor, each of whom has experienced the effects of these
drugs in his own person, and graphically described his sensations,
thoughts, feelings, and dreams while under their influence,
without being struck with awe and astonishment at the
modifying and disturbing influences which these substances
exert upon that mysterious connection which exists between
the mind and the material medium through which it manifests
itself. Take the following, for example, from the <cite>Confessions
of an English Opium-Eater</cite>, which, not only for grandeur of
description, but for psychological interest, is unsurpassed by
any thing in the English language.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The dream commenced with a music which now I often heard
in dreams,—a music of preparation and of awakening suspense;
a music like the opening of the Coronation Anthem, and which,
like <i>that</i>, gave the feeling of a vast march—of infinite cavalcades
filing off, and the tread of innumerable armies. The
morning was come of a mighty day—a day of crisis and of
final hope for human nature, then suffering some mysterious
eclipse and laboring in some dread extremity. Somewhere, I
knew not where—somehow, I knew not how—by some beings,
I knew not whom—a battle, a strife, an agony, was conducting,—was
evolving like a great drama, or piece of music; with
which my sympathy was the more insupportable from my confusion
as to its place, its cause, its nature, and its possible
issue. I, as is usual in dreams, (where, of necessity, we make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>ourselves central to every movement,) had the power, and yet
had not the power, to decide it. I had the power, if I could
raise myself, to will it; and yet again had not the power, for
the weight of twenty Atlantics was upon me, or the oppression
of inexpiable guilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Deeper than ever plummet sounded,’ I lay inactive. Then,
like a chorus, the passion deepened. Some greater interest was at
stake,—some mightier cause than ever yet the sword had
pleaded or trumpet had proclaimed. Then came sudden
alarms; hurryings to and fro; trepidations of innumerable
fugitives—I knew not whether from the good cause or the bad;
darkness and lights; tempest and human faces; and, at last,
with the sense that all was lost, female forms, and the features
that were worth all the world to me, and but a moment allowed—and
clasped hands, and heart-breaking partings, and then
everlasting farewells! and, with a sigh such as the caves of hell
sighed when the incestuous mother uttered the abhorred name
of death, the sound was reverberated,—everlasting farewells!
and again, and yet again, reverberated,—everlasting farewells!
And I awoke in struggles, and cried aloud, ‘I will sleep no
more!’”</p>

<p class='c000'>De Quincey took laudanum for the first time to dispel pain,
and he thus describes the effect it had upon him:—“But I
took it, and in an hour, oh, heavens! what a revulsion! what
an upheaving, from its lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what
an apocalypse of the world within me! That my pains had
vanished was now a trifle in my eyes. This <i>negative</i> effect was
swallowed up in the immensity of those positive effects which
had opened before me,—in the abyss of divine enjoyment thus
suddenly revealed. Here was a panacea,—a <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">φαρμακον νεπενθες</span>
for all human woes. Here was the secret of happiness, about
which philosophers had disputed for so many ages, at once discovered!
Happiness might now be bought for a penny and
carried in the waistcoat-pocket; portable ecstasies might be
had corked up in a pint bottle; and peace of mind could be
sent down in gallons by the mail-coach.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>Dr. Madden describes more soberly his sensations when under
the influence of the drug in one of the coffee-houses at Constantinople.
“I commenced with one grain. In the course of
an hour and a half it produced no perceptible effect. The
coffee-house keeper was very anxious to give me an additional
pill of two grains, but I was contented with half a one; and in
another half-hour, feeling nothing of the expected revery, I
took half a grain more, making in all two grains in the course
of two hours. After two hours and a half from the first dose,
my spirits became sensibly excited: the pleasure of the sensation
seemed to depend on a universal expansion of mind and
matter. My faculties appeared enlarged; every thing I looked
at seemed increased in volume; I had no longer the same
pleasure when I closed my eyes which I had when they were
open; it appeared to me as if it was only external objects
which were acted on by the imagination and magnified into
images of pleasure: in short, it was the ‘faint, exquisite music
of a dream’ in a waking moment. I made my way home
as fast as possible, dreading at every step that I should commit
some extravagance. In walking, I was hardly sensible of
my feet touching the ground: it seemed as if I slid along the
street impelled by some invisible agent, and that my blood was
composed of some ethereal fluid, which rendered my body
lighter than air. I got to bed the moment I reached home.
The most extraordinary visions of delight filled my brain all
night. In the morning I rose pale and dispirited; my head
ached; my body was so debilitated that I was obliged to remain
on the sofa all day, dearly paying for my first essay at
opium-eating.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These after-effects are the source of the misery of the opium-eater.
The exciting influence of the drug is almost invariably
followed by a corresponding depression. The susceptibility to
external impressions and the muscular energy are both lessened.
A desire for repose ensues, and a tendency to sleep. The mouth
and throat also become dry; the thirst is increased; hunger
diminishes; and the bowels usually become torpid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>When large doses are taken, all the above effects are hastened
and heightened in proportion. The period of depression
comes on sooner; the prostration of energy increases to actual
stupor, with or without dreams; the pulse becomes feeble, the
muscles exceedingly relaxed; and, if enough has been taken,
death ensues.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, all these effects are modified by the constitution of
the individual, by the length of time he has accustomed himself
to take it, and by the circumstances in which he is placed.
But upon all persons, and in all circumstances, its final effects,
like those of ardent spirits taken in large and repeated doses,
are equally melancholy and degrading. “A total attenuation
of body,” says Dr. Oppenheim, “a withered, yellow countenance,
a lame gait, a bending of the spine, frequently to such
a degree as to assume a circular form, and glassy, deep-sunken
eyes, betray the opium-eater at the first glance. The digestive
organs are in the highest degree disturbed: the sufferer eats
scarcely any thing, and has hardly one evacuation in a week.
His mental and bodily powers are destroyed: he is impotent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The influence upon the mental faculties of <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Haschisch</span></i>, or
East Indian hemp, when taken in large doses, is no less extraordinary
than that of opium.</p>

<p class='c000'>That accomplished traveller, Bayard Taylor, when in Damascus,
“prompted,” as he says, “by that insatiable curiosity
which led him to prefer the acquisition of all lawful knowledge
through the channel of his own experience,” was induced to
make a trial of this drug. Not knowing the strength of the
preparation he employed, he found himself, shortly after taking
the second dose, more thoroughly and completely under the
influence of the drug than was either pleasant or safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the effects of the stronger dose, he says, “The
same fine nervous thrill of which I have spoken suddenly shot
through me. But this time it was accompanied with a burning
sensation at the pit of the stomach; and, instead of growing
upon me with the gradual pace of healthy slumber, and resolving
me, as before, into air, it came with the intensity of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>pang, and shot throbbing along the nerves to the extremities
of my body. The sense of limitation—the confinement of our
senses within the bounds of our own flesh and blood—instantly
fell away. The walls of my frame were burst outward, and
tumbled into ruin; and, without thinking what form I wore,—losing
sight even of all idea of form,—I felt that I existed
throughout a vast extent of space. The blood pulsed from my
heart, sped through uncounted leagues before it reached my
extremities; the air drawn into my lungs expanded into seas
of limpid ether; and the arch of my skull was broader than the
vault of heaven. Within the concave that held my brain were
the fathomless deeps of blue; clouds floated there, and the
winds of heaven rolled them together; and there shone the orb
of the sun. It was—though I thought not of that at the time—<i>like
a revelation of the mystery of Omnipresence</i>.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EFFECTS OF FEAR.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is a common practice, in many parts of India, to oblige
persons suspected of crimes to chew dry rice in presence of
the officers of the law. Curious as it may appear, such is
the intense influence of fear on the salivary glands, that, if they
are actually guilty, there is no secretion of saliva in the mouth,
and chewing is impossible. Such culprits generally confess
without any further efforts. On the contrary, a consciousness
of innocence allows of a proper flow of fluid for softening the
rice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of our readers are familiar with the case of the thief to
whom, in common with other suspected persons, a stick of a
certain length was given, with the assurance that the stick of
the thief would grow by supernatural power. The culprit, imagining
that his stick had actually increased in length, broke a
piece off, and was thus detected. A similar anecdote is told of
a farmer who detected depredations on his corn-bin by calling
his men together and making them mix up a quantity of
feathers in a sieve, assuring them, at the same time, that the
feathers would infallibly stick to the hair of the thief. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>a short time, one of the men raised his hand repeatedly to his
head, and thus betrayed himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Parisian physician, during his visits made in a hired fly,
had received a bottle of real Jamaica rum as a sample, but
found, after returning home, that he had left it in the carriage.
He went to the office, and informed the manager that he had
left a virulent poison in one of the carriages, and desired him
to prevent any of the coachmen from drinking it. Hardly had
he got back when he was summoned in great haste to three of
these worthies, who were suffering from the most horrible colic;
and great was his difficulty in persuading them that they had
only stolen some most excellent rum.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most singular examples on record of the effect of
fear acting through the imagination is given by Breschet, a
French author of the sixteenth century, who informs us that
the physicians at Montpellier, which was then a great school of
medicine, had every year two criminals, the one living, the other
dead, delivered to them for dissection. On one occasion they determined
to try what effect the mere expectation of death would
produce upon a subject in perfect health; and in order to carry
out the experiment they told the gentleman (for such was his
rank) who was placed at their discretion, that, as the easiest
mode of taking away his life, they would employ the means
which Seneca had chosen for himself, and would therefore open
his veins in warm water. Accordingly they covered his face,
pinched his feet, without lancing them, and set them in a footbath,
and then spoke to each other as if they saw that the
blood was flowing freely, and life departing with it. The man
remained motionless; and when, after a while, they uncovered
his face, they found him dead.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FACIAL EXPRESSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The facial nerve, which presides over the movements of the
face, gives to the physiognomy its different expressions so as to reflect
the passions and emotions of the soul. To prove this experimentally,
Charles Bell took the most cunning and impressionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>monkey he could find in the menagerie of Exeter Change, and
divided its facial nerve on one side. Excited by pain, the poor
monkey made faces with tenfold energy, but exactly and solely
with one side of his face, while the other remained perfectly
impassible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, no one would repeat this experiment on man; but
nature sometimes takes the whim to make such a curiosity.
All who saw the unfortunate monkey were struck with the
strange analogy which its features presented with those of a
comic actor then much in vogue in London, who could reproduce
all sorts of expressions and mirror every passion with one
side of his face, while he kept the other side in a state of perfect
immobility. The experiment of Charles Bell gave the key
to the enigma. The mimic was the victim of a facial hemiplegia,
from some accident to the facial nerve; and he had the
shrewdness to make people believe that voluntary which he
could not prevent, and thus to profit by an otherwise mortifying
affliction.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A BROKEN HEART.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following interesting case of a literally <i>broken heart</i> was
related by a late distinguished medical professor of Philadelphia,
to his class, while lecturing upon the diseases of the
heart. It will be seen, on perusing it, that the expression
“broken-hearted” is not merely figurative.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early part of his career, Dr. Mitchell accompanied, as
surgeon, a packet that sailed between Liverpool and one of our
Southern ports. On the return-voyage, soon after leaving
Liverpool, while the doctor and the captain of the vessel, a
weather-beaten son of Neptune, but possessed of uncommonly
fine feelings and strong impulses, were conversing in the
latter’s state-room, the captain opened a large chest, and carefully
took out a number of articles of various descriptions,
which he arranged upon a table. Dr. M., surprised at the display
of costly jewels, ornaments, dresses, and all the varied
paraphernalia of which ladies are naturally fond, inquired of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>the captain his object in having made so many valuable purchases.
The sailor, in reply, said, that for seven or eight years
he had been devotedly attached to a lady, to whom he had
several times made proposals of marriage, but was as often rejected;
that her refusal to wed him, however, had only stimulated
his love to greater exertion; and that finally, upon renewing
his offer, declaring in the ardency of his passion that,
without her society, life was not worth living for, she consented
to become his bride upon his return from his next voyage. He
was so overjoyed at the prospect of a marriage from which, in
the warmth of his feelings, he probably anticipated more happiness
than is usually allotted to mortals, that he spent all his
ready money, while in London, for bridal gifts. After gazing
at them fondly for some time, and remarking on them in turn,
“I think this will please Annie,” and “I am sure she will like
that,” he replaced them with the utmost care. This ceremony
he repeated every day during the voyage; and the doctor often
observed a tear glisten in his eye as he spoke of the pleasure
he would have in presenting them to his affianced bride. On
reaching his destination, the captain arrayed himself with more
than his usual precision, and disembarked as soon as possible,
to hasten to his love. As he was about to step into the carriage
awaiting him, he was called aside by two gentlemen who
desired to make a communication, the purport of which was
that the lady had proved unfaithful to the trust reposed in
her, and had married another, with whom she had decamped
shortly before. Instantly the captain was observed to clap his
hand to his breast and fall heavily to the ground. He was
taken up, and conveyed to his room on the vessel. Dr. M. was
immediately summoned; but, before he reached the poor captain,
he was dead. A post-mortem examination revealed the
cause of his unfortunate decease. His heart was found literally
torn in twain! The tremendous propulsion of the blood, consequent
upon such a violent nervous shock, forced the powerful
muscular tissues asunder, and life was at an end. The heart
was broken.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>SENSATION AND INTELLIGENCE AFTER DECAPITATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>While some physiologists are of opinion that death by beheading
is attended with less actual pain than any other manner
of death, and is, therefore, the most <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">humane</span></i> mode of dis-embarrassing
society of a villain, others contend, and adduce
an equally formidable array of facts to show, that intense agony
is experienced, after decollation, in both the head and the
body, and that death by the guillotine, so far from being easier
than hanging, is one of the most painful known. Whatever
may really be the sensations attendant upon the separation of
the head from the body, we have, at least, some curious facts,
which throw a little light on the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is related that a professor of physiology at Genoa, who
has made this interesting subject his particular study, states
that, having exposed two heads, a quarter of an hour after decollation,
to a strong light, the eyelids closed suddenly. The
tongue, which protruded from the lips, being pricked with a
needle, was drawn back into the mouth, and the countenance
expressed sudden pain. The head of a criminal named Tillier
being submitted to examination after the guillotine, the eyes
turned in every direction from whence he was called by name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fontenelle declares that he has frequently seen the heads of
guillotined persons move their lips, as if they were uttering
remonstrances against their cruel treatment. If this be so,
there is nothing very incredible in the report, sometimes treated
as fabulous, that when the executioner gave a blow on the face
of Charlotte Corday after the head was severed from the body,
<i>the countenance</i> expressed violent indignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated on credible authority that some galvanic experiments
were once tried on the body of a habitual snuff-taker,
after he had undergone the operation of being guillotined. On
receiving the first shock, the headless trunk joined its thumb
and fore-finger, and deliberately raised its right arm, as if in
the act of taking its customary <i>pinch</i>, and seemed much astonished
and perplexed at finding <i>no nose</i> to receive its wonted
tribute!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>But the most marvellous tale is told of Sir Everard Digby,
who was beheaded in 1600 for being concerned in the famous
Gunpowder Plot. After the head was struck off, the executioner
proceeded, according to the barbarous usages of the day,
to pluck the heart from his body; and when he had done so, he
held it up in full view of the numerous assemblage gathered
round the scaffold to witness the exhibition, and shouted, with
a loud voice, <i>This is the heart of a traitor!</i> Upon which, the
<i>head</i>, which was quietly resting on the scaffold, at the distance
of a few feet, showed sundry signs of indignation, and, opening
its mouth, audibly exclaimed, “<i>That is a lie!</i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>The reader will be reminded, by this case of the English
knight, of the conjurer in the Arabian Nights, who, in consequence
of a failure in his necromancy, was decapitated by the
order and in the presence of the Sultan. The head of the sorcerer,
after separation from his body, sat erect upon the floor,
and, with a mysterious expression of countenance, informed his
highness that as he rather thought he should have no further
occasion for his books of magic, he would make a present of
them to him; and since he could not very well go to fetch them
himself, if his highness would take the trouble to send for
them, he would instruct him in their use. On being brought,
he told the Sultan it was first necessary for him to turn over
every leaf in the books from the beginning to the end. But
he found it was impossible to do this, as they stuck together,
without often wetting his fingers at his mouth. This infused
into the monarch’s veins a subtle and virulent venom, as the
books were poisoned, in consequence of which he died very
soon in torture, overwhelmed with the taunts and curses of the
decapitated head.</p>

<p class='c000'>A case occurred some years ago at Ticonderoga, N. Y., which
settles the question of pain, so far as the body is concerned,
and proves that no sensations whatever can exist in the <i>body</i>
after its connection with the brain is dissolved. It was reported
at the time in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal,
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>E. D., aged fifty, a man of hale constitution and robust, in
making an effort to scale a board fence, was suddenly precipitated
backwards to the ground, striking first upon the superior
and anterior portion of the head, which luxated the
dentatus anteriorly on the third cervical vertebra. He was at
length discovered, and taken in (as the patient said) after he
had lain nearly an hour, in a condition perfectly bereft of voluntary
motion; but, being present, I did not suspect that the
power of sensation was also gone, until the patient (whose
speech remained almost, or quite, perfect, and who was uncommonly
loquacious at that time) said, did he not know to the
contrary, he should think that he had no body. His flesh was
then punctured, and sometimes deeply, even from the feet to
the neck; but the patient gave no evidence of feeling, and,
when interrogated, answered that he felt nothing; and, added
he, “I never was more perfectly free from pain in my life;”
but he remarked that he could not live, and accordingly sent
for his family, twelve miles distant, and arranged all his various
concerns in a perfectly sane manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The head was thrown back in such a position as to prevent
his seeing his body. The pulse was much more sluggish than
natural. Respiration and speech, but slightly affected, were
gradually failing; but he could articulate distinctly until
within a few minutes of his death. All the senses of the head
remained quite perfect to the last. He died forty-eight hours
after the fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Repeated attempts were made to reduce the dislocation, but
the transverse processes had become so interlocked that every
effort proved abortive. There was undoubtedly in this case a
perfect compression of the spinal marrow, which prevented the
egress of nervous influence from the brain, while the pneumogastric
nerve remained unembarrassed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ANTIPATHIES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Antipathies are as various as they are unaccountable, and
often in appearance ridiculous. Yet who can control them, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>reason himself into a conviction that they are absurd? They
are, in truth, natural infirmities or peculiarities, and not fantastical
imaginings. In the French “Ana” we find mention of
a lady who would faint on seeing boiled lobsters; and several
persons are mentioned, among them Mary de Medicis, who
experienced the same inconvenience from the smell of roses,
though particularly partial to the odor of jonquils and hyacinths.
Another is recorded who invariably fell into convulsions
at the sight of a carp. Erasmus, although a native of
Rotterdam, had such an aversion to fish of any kind that the
smell alone threw him into a fever. Ambrose Paré mentions
a patient of his who could never look at an eel without falling
into a fit. Joseph Scaliger and Peter Abono could neither of
them drink milk. Cardan was particularly disgusted at the sight
of eggs. Ladislaus, King of Poland, fell sick if he saw an apple;
and if that fruit was exhibited to Chesne, secretary to Francis I.,
a prodigious quantity of blood would issue from his nose. Henry
III. of France could not endure to sit in a room with a cat,
and the Duke of Schomberg ran out of any chamber into which
one entered. A gentleman in the court of the Emperor Ferdinand
would bleed at the nose even if he heard the mewing
of the obnoxious animal, no matter at how great a distance.
M. de l’Ancre, in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tableau de l’Inconstance de Toutes
Choses</span></cite>, gives an account of a very sensible man, who was so
terrified on seeing a hedgehog that for two years he imagined
his bowels were gnawed by such an animal. In the same book
we find an account of an officer of distinguished bravery who
never dared to face a mouse, it would so terrify him, unless he
had his sword in his hand. M. de l’Ancre says he knew the
individual perfectly well. There are some persons who cannot
bear to see spiders, and others who eat them as a luxury, as
they do snails and frogs. M. Vangheim, a celebrated huntsman
in Hanover, would faint outright, or, if he had sufficient
time, would run away, at the sight of a roast pig. The philosopher
Chrysippus had such an aversion to external reverence,
that, if any one saluted him, he would involuntarily fall down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>Valerius Maximus says that this Chrysippus died of laughing
at seeing an ass eat figs out of a silver plate. John Rol, a gentleman
of Alcantara, would swoon on hearing the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lana</span></i>
(wool) pronounced, although his cloak was made of wool.
Lord Bacon fainted at every eclipse of the moon. Tycho Brahe
shuddered at the sight of a fox; Ariosto, at the sight of a bath;
and Cæsar trembled at the crowing of a cock.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STRANGE INSTANCE OF SYMPATHY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Duke de Saint Simon mentions in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</span></cite> a singular
instance of constitutional sympathy existing between two
brothers. These were twins,—the President de Banquemore,
and the Governor de Bergues, who were surprisingly alike, not
only in their persons, but in their feelings. One morning, he
tells us, when the President was at the royal audience he was
suddenly attacked by an intense pain in the thigh: at the same
instant, as it was discovered afterwards, his brother, who was
with the army, received a severe wound from a sword on the
same leg, and precisely the same part of the leg!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WALKING BLINDFOLDED.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The difficulty of walking to any given point blindfolded can
only be conceived by those who have made the experiment.
After wandering about in every possible direction, now east,
now west, at one time forward, at another time backward,
working for a while at the zigzag, then shooting out like an
arrow from a bow, and not unfrequently describing a complete
circle like a miller’s horse, the party is generally a thousand
times more likely to end his travels at the spot from which he
set out, than at the spot to which he wished to go. The following
achievement presents as extraordinary an exception to the
general experience on this head, as perhaps ever occurred:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Dennis Hendrick, a stone-mason, for a wager of ten guineas,
walked from the Exchange in Liverpool, along Deal Street, to
the corner of Byrom Street,—being a distance of three-quarters
of a mile,—blindfolded, and rolling a coach-wheel. On starting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>there were two plasters of Burgundy pitch put on his eyes, and
a handkerchief tied over them, to prevent all possibility of his
seeing. He started precisely at half-past seven in the morning,
and completed his undertaking at twenty minutes past
eight, being in fifty minutes.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FELINE CLOCKS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>M. Huc, in his recent work on the Chinese Empire, tells us
that “one day, when we went to pay a visit to some families
of Chinese Christian peasants, we met, near a farm, a young
lad, who was taking a buffalo to graze along our path. We
asked him carelessly, as we passed, whether it was yet noon.
The child raised his head to look at the sun; but it was hidden
behind thick clouds, and he could read no answer there. ‘The
sky is so cloudy,’ said he; ‘but wait a moment;’ and with
these words he ran towards the farm, and came back a few moments
afterward with a cat in his arms. ‘Look here,’ said
he, ‘it is not noon yet;’ and he showed us the cat’s eyes, by
pushing up the lids with his hands. We looked at the child
with surprise, but he was evidently in earnest; and the cat,
though astonished, and not much pleased at the experiment
made on her eyes, behaved with the most exemplary complaisance.
‘Very well,’ said we: ‘thank you;’ and he then let
go the cat, who made her escape pretty quickly, and we continued
our route. To say the truth, we had not at all understood
the proceeding; but we did not wish to question the little
pagan, lest he should find out that we were Europeans by our
ignorance. As soon as we reached the farm, however, we made
haste to ask our Christians whether they could tell the clock by
looking into a cat’s eyes. They seemed surprised at the question;
but, as there was no danger in confessing to them our
ignorance of the properties of the cat’s eyes, we related what
had just taken place. That was all that was necessary. Our
complaisant neophytes immediately gave chase to all the cats
in the neighborhood. They brought us three or four, and explained
in what manner they might be made use of for watches.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>They pointed out that the pupil of their eyes went on constantly
growing narrower until twelve o’clock, when they became like
a fine line, as thin as a hair, drawn perpendicularly across the
eye, and that after twelve the dilatation recommenced. When
we had attentively examined the eyes of all the cats at our disposal,
we came to the conclusion that it was past noon, as all
the eyes perfectly agreed upon the point.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DEVONSHIRE SUPERSTITION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following case of gross superstition, which occurred
lately in one of the largest market-towns in the north of
Devon, is related by an eye-witness:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A young woman living in the neighborhood of Holsworthy,
having for some time past been subject to periodical fits of illness,
endeavored to effect a cure by attending at the afternoon
service at the parish church, accompanied by thirty young men,
her near neighbors. Service over, she sat in the porch of the
church, and each of the young men, as they passed out in succession,
dropped a penny into her lap; but the last, instead of
a penny, gave her half a crown, taking from her the twenty-nine
pennies which she had already received. With this half-crown
in her hand, she walked three times round the communion-table,
and afterwards had it made into a ring, by the
wearing of which she believes she will recover her health.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A SKULL THAT HAD A TONGUE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When Dr. John Donne, the famous poet and divine of the
reign of James I., attained possession of his first living, he took
a walk into the churchyard, where the sexton was at the time
digging a grave, and in the course of his labor threw up a
skull. This skull the doctor took in his hands, and found a
rusty headless nail sticking in the temple of it, which he drew
out secretly and wrapped in the corner of his handkerchief.
He then demanded of the grave-digger whether he knew whose
skull that was. He said it was a man’s who kept a brandy-shop,—an
honest, drunken fellow, who one night, having taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>two quarts, was found dead in his bed next morning. “Had
he a wife?” “Yes.” “What character does she bear?” “A
very good one: only the neighbors reflect on her because she
married the day after her husband was buried.” This was
enough for the doctor, who, under the pretence of visiting his
parishioners, called on the woman: he asked her several questions,
and, among others, what sickness her husband died of.
She gave him the same account he had before received, whereupon
he suddenly opened the handkerchief, and cried, in an authoritative
voice, “Woman, do you know this nail?” She was
struck with horror at the unexpected demand, instantly owned
the fact, and was brought to trial and executed. Truly might
one say, with even more point than Hamlet, that the skull had
a tongue in it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ROMANTIC HIGHWAYMAN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In a letter to Mr. Mead, preserved among that gentleman’s
papers in the British Museum, and dated February 3, 1625, is
the following account of a singular highwayman:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Clavell, a gentleman, a knight’s eldest son, a great mail
and highway robber, was, together with a soldier, his companion,
arraigned and condemned on Monday last, at the
King’s Bench bar: he pleaded for himself that he never had
struck or wounded any man, never taken any thing from their
bodies, as rings, &amp;c., never cut their girths or saddles, or done
them, when he robbed, any corporeal violence. He was, with
his companion, reprieved; he sent the following verses to the
king for mercy, and hath obtained it:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I that have robbed so oft am now bid stand;</div>
      <div class='line'>Death and the law assault me, and demand</div>
      <div class='line'>My life and means: I never used men so,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, having ta’en their money, let them go.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, must I die? and is there no relief?</div>
      <div class='line'>The King of kings had mercy on a thief!</div>
      <div class='line'>So may our gracious king, too, if he please,</div>
      <div class='line'>Without his council grant me a release;</div>
      <div class='line'>God is his precedent, and men shall see</div>
      <div class='line'>His mercy go beyond severity.</div>

  <h2 id='c477' class='c006'>Singular Customs.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>MEMENTO MORI.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The ancient Egyptians, at their grand festivals and parties
of pleasure, always had a coffin placed on the table at meals,
containing a mummy, or a skeleton of painted wood, which, Herodotus
tells us, was presented to each of the guests with this
admonition:—“Look upon this, and enjoy yourself; for such
will you become when divested of your mortal garb.” This
custom is frequently alluded to by Horace and Catullus; and
Petronius tells us that at the celebrated banquet of Trimalcion
a silver skeleton was placed on the table to awaken in the
minds of the guests the remembrance of death and of deceased
friends.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BEAUTIFUL SUPERSTITION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the superstitions of the Seneca Indians was one remarkable
for its singular beauty. When a maiden died, they
imprisoned a young bird until it first began to try its powers
of song, and then, loading it with messages and caresses, they
loosed its bonds over her grave, in the belief that it would not
fold its wing nor close its eyes until it had flown to the spirit-land
and delivered its precious burden of affection to the loved
and lost.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STRANGE FONDNESS FOR BEAUTY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In Carazan, a province to the northeast of Tartary, the inhabitants
have a custom, says Dr. Heylin, when a stranger of
handsome shape and fine features comes into their houses, of
killing him in the night,—not out of desire of spoil, or to eat
his body, but that the soul of such a comely person might remain
among them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>THE FOUNDATIONS OF DRUIDICAL TEMPLES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is a curious tradition both of St. Patrick in Ireland,
and of St. Columba in Iona, that when they attempted to found
churches they were impeded by an evil spirit, who threw down
the walls as fast as they were built, until a human victim was
sacrificed and buried under the foundation, which being done,
they stood firm.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be feared that there is too much truth in this story.
Not, of course, that such a thing was done by either a Christian
Patrick or Columba, but by the Druids, from whom the story
was fathered upon the former. Under each of the twelve pillars
of one of the Druidical circular temples in Iona a human body
was found to have been buried.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ABYSSINIAN BEEFSTEAKS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller, has frequently been
ridiculed for asserting that it is a practice in Abyssinia to cut
slices from the backs of their cattle while alive, and then drive
them back to pasture; but his statements have been confirmed
by more recent travellers. Mr. Salt says that a soldier belonging
to the party to which he was attached took one of the cows
they were driving before them, cut off two pieces of flesh from
the glutæi muscles of the buttock, near the tail, and then sewed
up the wound, plastering it over with manure, after which the
party proceeded to cook the steaks.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OSTIAK REGARD FOR BEARS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Tooke, in his work on Russia, tells us of a strange custom
that prevails among the Ostiaks,—a Finnish nation. The Ostiaks,
says he, believe that bears enjoy after death a happiness
at least equal to that which they expect for themselves. Whenever
they kill one of these animals, therefore, they sing songs
over him, in which they ask his pardon, and hang up his skin,
to which they show many civilities and pay many fine compliments,
in order to induce him not to wreak his vengeance upon
them in the abode of spirits.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>MAKING NOSES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At Kat Kangra, a place visited by the traveller Vigne, at
the base of the Himalaya, there are native surgeons, celebrated
for putting on new noses. The maimed come a great distance
for repairs. When it is recollected that the rajahs cut off ears
and noses without stint, it may be readily supposed that these
surgeons have plenty of patients. The hope of a restoration of
the nasal organ brings them from remote distances. To all intents
and purposes, it is done like the Taliacotian operation in
our hospitals,—by taking a flap of integument from the forehead.
With very simple instruments, and a little cotton wool
besmeared with pitch, to keep the parts together, the success is
sufficient to extend the reputation of the rude operators.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LION-CATCHING IN SOUTH AFRICA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Lemue, who formerly resided at Motito, and is familiar
with the Kallibari country, assures us that the remarkable accounts
sometimes circulated as to the people of that part of
Africa catching lions by the tail—of which, one would naturally
be incredulous—were perfectly true. Lions would sometimes become
extremely dangerous to the inhabitants. Having become
accustomed to human flesh, they would not willingly eat any
thing else. When a neighborhood became infested, the men
would determine on the measures to be adopted to rid themselves
of the nuisance; then, forming themselves into a band,
they would proceed in search of their royal foe, and beard the
lion in his lair. Standing close by one another, the lion would
make his spring on some one of the party,—every man, of
course, hoping he might escape the attack,—when instantly
others would dash forward and seize his tail, lifting it up close
to the body with all their might; thus not only astonishing the
animal, and absolutely taking him off his guard, but rendering
his efforts powerless for the moment; while others closed in
with their spears, and at once stabbed the monster through and
through.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>HIGH LIFE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We gain the following glimpse of the manners of the upper
classes in England, four hundred years ago, from the Journal
of Elizabeth Woodville, subsequently Lady Grey, and finally
Queen of Edward IV. Royalty <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">in petto</span></i> seems to have taken,
with a most refreshing cordiality, to the avocations of baking
and brewing, pig-tending, poultry-feeding, and pony-catching.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Monday morning.</i>—Rose at 4 o’clock, and helped Catharine to milk the
cows. Rachel, the dairy-maid, having scalded her hand in so bad a manner
the night before, made a poultice, and gave Robin a penny to get something
from the apothecary.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>6 o’clock.</i>—The buttock of beef too much boiled, and beer a little stale;
(mem. to talk to the cook about the first fault, and to mend the other myself
by tapping a fresh barrel immediately.)</p>

<p class='c018'><i>7 o’clock.</i>—Went to walk with the lady my mother in the court-yard; fed
twenty-five men and women; chid Roger severely for expressing some ill
will at attending us with some broken meat.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>8 o’clock.</i>—Went into the paddock behind the house with my maid Dorothy;
caught Thump, the little pony, myself; rode a matter of ten miles
without saddle or bridle.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>10 o’clock.</i>—Went to dinner. John Grey, a most comely youth; but what
is that to me? a virtuous maid should be entirely under the direction of her
parents. John ate but little, and stole a great many tender glances at me.
Said women could never be handsome in his eyes who were not good-tempered.
I hope my temper is not intolerable: nobody finds fault with it but
Roger, and he is the most disorderly youth in our house. John Grey likes
white teeth: my teeth are a pretty good color. I think my hair is as black
as jet,—though I say it; and John Grey, if I mistake not, is of the same
opinion.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>11 o’clock.</i>—Rose from the table; the company all desirous of walking in
the field. John Grey lifted me over every stile, and twice squeezed my
hand with much vehemence. I cannot say I should have much objection,
for he plays at prison-bar as well as any of the country gentlemen, is remarkably
dutiful to his parents, my lord and lady, and never misses church
on Sunday.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>3 o’clock.</i>—Poor Farmer Robinson’s house burned down by accidental
fire. John Grey proposed a subscription among the company for the relief
of the farmer, and gave no less than four pounds with this benevolent
intent. (Mem. never saw him look so comely as at this moment.)</p>

<p class='c018'><i>4 o’clock.</i>—Went to prayers.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>6 o’clock.</i>—Fed hogs and poultry.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>HAIR IN SEALS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Stillingfleet, referring to a MS. author who wrote a chronicle
of St. Augustine, says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>He observes one particular custom of the Normans, <i>that they
were wont to put some of the hair of their heads or beards

<h3 class='c012'>SCORNING THE CHURCH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In North Durham, it is customary, in case that the banns
of marriage are thrice published, and the marriage does not
take place, for the refusing party, whether male or female, to
pay forty shillings to the vicar as a penalty for <i>scorning the

roasted; Edward Clement gives a fat lamb to be roasted; Joseph Gibson
gives a fat pig to be roasted; William Hughes gives a fat calf to be roasted.</p>

Pearson, Betty Hughes, Mary Bushby, Molly Fisher, Sarah Briscoe, and
Betty Porthoust, give, each of them, a pound of butter. The advertiser will
provide every thing else suitable for so festive an occasion: and he hereby
gives notice to all young women desirous of changing their condition, that
he is at present disengaged, and he advises them to consider that although
there may be luck in leisure, yet, in this case, delays are dangerous; for
with him, he is determined that it shall be—first come, first served.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE JESTS OF HIEROCLES.</h3>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>A young</span> man, meeting an acquaintance, said, “I heard that
you were dead.” “But,” says the other, “you see me alive.”
“I do not know how that may be,” replied he: “you are a notorious
liar; but my informant was a person of credit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A man wrote to a friend in Greece, begging him to purchase
books. From negligence or avarice, he neglected to execute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>the commission; but, fearing that his correspondent might be
offended, he exclaimed, when next they met, “My dear friend,
I never got the letter you wrote to me about the books.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An irritable man went to visit a sick friend, and asked him
concerning his health. The patient was so ill that he could not
reply; whereupon the other, in a rage, said, “I hope that I
may soon fall sick, and then I will not answer you when you
visit me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A speculative gentleman, wishing to teach his horse to live
without food, starved him to death. “I suffered a great loss,”
said he, “for just as he learned to live without eating, he
died.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A robust countryman, meeting a physician, ran to hide behind
a wall: being asked the cause, he replied, “It is so long since
I have been sick, that I am ashamed to look a physician in the
face.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious inquirer, desirous to know how he looked when
asleep, sat with closed eyes before a mirror.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man, hearing that a raven would live two hundred years,
bought one to try.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of twin brothers died: a fellow, meeting the survivor,
asked, “Which is it that’s dead, you or your brother?”</p>

<p class='c000'>A man who had to cross a river entered a boat on horseback:
being asked why, he replied, “I must ride, because I
am in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A foolish fellow, having a house to sell, took a brick from the
wall to exhibit as a sample.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man, meeting a friend, said, “I spoke to you last night in
a dream.” “Pardon me,” replied the other; “I did not hear
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A man that had nearly been drowned while bathing, declared
that he would never enter the water again till he had learned
to swim.</p>

<p class='c000'>A student in want of money sold his books, and wrote
home, “Father, rejoice; for I now derive my support from
literature.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>During a storm, the passengers on board a vessel that appeared
in danger seized different implements to aid them in

anchor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wittol, a barber, and a bald-headed man travelled together.
Losing their way, they were forced to sleep in the open air;
and, to avert danger, it was agreed to keep watch by turns. The
lot fell first on the barber, who, for amusement, shaved the
fool’s head while he slept; he then woke him, and the fool,
raising his hand to scratch his head, exclaimed, “Here’s a
pretty mistake! Rascal, you have waked the bald-headed man
instead of me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A gentleman had a cask of fine wine, from which his servant
stole a large quantity. When the master perceived the deficiency,
he diligently inspected the top of the cask, but could
find no traces of an opening. “Look if there be not a hole in
the bottom,” said a bystander. “Blockhead,” he replied, “do
you not see that the deficiency is at the top, and not at the
bottom?”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BREVITY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The London member of the house of Rothschild once wrote

<p class='c000'>Mr. McNair, a man of few words, wrote to his nephew at

<p class='c000'>The long of this short was, that the uncle wrote to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>nephew, <i>See my coal on</i>, which a se-mi-col-on expressed; and
the youngster informed his uncle that the coal was shipped, by
simply saying, <i>Col-on</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Lord Buckley married a rich and beautiful lady, whose
hand had been solicited at the same time by Lord Powis, in the
height of his felicity he wrote thus to the Duke of Dorset:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis XIV., who loved a concise style, one day met a priest
on the road, whom he asked, hastily,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whence came you—where are you going—what do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The priest instantly replied,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“From Bruges—to Paris—a benefice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall have it,” replied the king.</p>

<p class='c000'>A lady having occasion to call upon Abernethy, the great
surgeon, and knowing his repugnance to any thing like verbosity,
forbore speaking except simply in reply to his laconic inquiries.
The consultation, during three visits, was conducted
in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c000'><i>First Day.</i>—(Lady enters and holds out her finger.) <i>Abernethy.</i>—“Cut?”
<i>Lady.</i>—“Bite.” <i>A.</i>—“Dog?” <i>L.</i>—“Parrot.”
<i>A.</i>—“Go home and poultice it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Second Day.</i>—(Finger held out again.) <i>A.</i>—“Better?”
<i>L.</i>—“Worse.” <i>A.</i>—“Go home and poultice it again.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Third Day.</i>—(Finger held out as before.) <i>A.</i>—“Better?”
<i>L.</i>—“Well.” <i>A.</i>—“You’re the most sensible woman I ever
met with. Good-bye. Get out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Since Cæsar’s famous “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">veni, vidi, vici</span></i>,” (I came, I saw, I
conquered,) many military commanders have rendered their
despatches memorable for pith and conciseness; but Sir Sidney
Smith bears the palm for both wit and brevity in his announcement
of the capture of Scinde:—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peccavi</span></i>” (I have
sinned). Gen. Havelock’s “We are in <i>Lucknow</i>” has already
become a matter of history.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>The following <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</span></i>, written in 1793, was occasioned
by the circumstance of Lord Howe returning from his pursuit
of the French fleet, after an absence of six weeks, during which
he had only <i>seen</i> the enemy, without having been able to overtake
and bring them to action:—</p>

<p class='c000'>If brevity is the soul of wit, Talleyrand was the greatest of
wits. A single word was often sufficient for his keenest retort.
When a hypochondriac, who had notoriously led a profligate life,
complained to the diplomatist that he was enduring the torments
of hell,—“Je sens les tourmens de l’enfer,”—the answer
was, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Déjà?</span></i>” (Already?) To a lady who had lost her husband
Talleyrand once addressed a letter of condolence in two
words:—“O, Madame!” In less than a year the lady had married
again; and then his letter of congratulation was, “Ah,
Madame!” Could any thing be more wittily significant than
the “O” and the “Ah” of this sententious correspondence?</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SAME JOKE DIVERSIFIED.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Prince Metternich once requested the autograph of Jules
Janin. The witty journalist sent him the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I acknowledge the receipt from M. de Metternich of twenty
bottles of Johannisberg, for which I return infinite thanks.</p>

<div class='c038'>“<span class='sc'>Jules Janin.</span>”</div>

<p class='c000'>The prince, in return, doubled the quantity, and sent him
forty bottles.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is equal to the joke of Rochester on the occasion of
Charles II.’s crew of rakes writing pieces of poetry and handing
them to Dryden, so that he might decide which was the
prettiest poet. Rochester finished his piece in a few minutes;
and Dryden decided that it was the best. On reading it, the
lines were found to be the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I promise to pay, to the order of John Dryden, twenty
pounds.—<span class='sc'>Rochester.</span>”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>The following hyperbolical compliment paid to Louis XIV.,
after his numerous victories, is almost literally translated from
the French of a Gascon author of those days, and, extraordinary
as it may seem, is said to have obtained for the writer of
it the premium alluded to in his gasconade:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The Emperor Nicholas of Russia was thus “sold,” a few
years ago. During an interview which Martineff, the comedian
and mimic, had succeeded in obtaining with the Prince,
(Volkhonsky, high steward,) the emperor walked into the room
unexpectedly, yet with a design, as was soon made evident.
Telling the actor that he had heard of his talents and should
like to see a specimen of them, he bade him mimic the old
minister. This feat was performed with so much gusto that
the emperor laughed immoderately, and then, to the great horror
of the poor actor, desired to have himself “taken off.”
“’Tis physically impossible,” pleaded Martineff. “Nonsense!”
said Nicholas: “I insist on its being done.” Finding
himself on the horns of a dilemma, the mimic took heart of
grace, and, with a promptitude and presence of mind that probably
saved him, buttoned his coat over his breast, expanded
his chest, threw up his head, and, assuming the imperial port to
the best of his power, strode across the room and back; then,
stopping opposite the minister, he cried, in the exact tone and
manner of the Czar, “Volkhonsky! pay Monsieur Martineff
one thousand silver roubles.” The emperor for a moment was
disconcerted; but, recovering himself with a faint smile, he
ordered the money to be paid.</p>

Bank, there was an old negro hanger-on about the premises
named Harry. One day, in a social mood, Biddle said to the
darkey, “Well what is your name, my old friend?” “Harry, sir—ole
Harry, sir,” said the other, touching his shabby hat.
“Old Harry!” said Biddle, “why that is the name that they
give to the devil, is it not?” “Yes, sir,” said the colored gentleman,
“sometimes ole Harry and sometimes ole Nick.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A FALSE FRIEND.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“You may say what you please,” said Bill Muggins, speaking
of a deceased comrade, “Jake was a good boy, he was, and a great
hunter; but he was the meanest man that ever breathed in Old
Kentuck; and he played one of the sharpest tricks you ever
heard of, and I’ll tell you how it was. I was out shootin’ with
him one mornin’. I tell you the duck was plenty; and other
game we despised as long as we could see duck. Jake he was
too mean to blaze away unless he could shoot two or three at a
shot. He used to blow me up for wastin’ shot and powder so,
but I didn’t care—I banged away. Well, somehow or other,
while fussin’ around the boat, my powder-flask fell overboard in
about sixteen feet of water, which was as clear as good gin, and
I could see the flask lay at the bottom. Jake was a good
swimmer, and a good diver, and he said he’d fetch her up; so in
a minit he was in. Well, I waited quite a considerable time
for him to come up; then I looked over the side for him. Great
Jerusalem! there sot old Jake on a pile of oyster-shells pourin’
the powder out of my flask into his’n. Wasn’t that mean?”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>GASCONADE AND HOAXING.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A Gascon, in proof of his nobility, asserted that in his
father’s castle they used no other firewood than the batons of
the different marshals of France of his family.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Gascon officer, on hearing of the boastful exploits of a certain
prince, who, among other things, had killed six men with
his own hands in the course of an assault upon a city, said, disdainfully,
“Poh, that’s nothing: the mattress I sleep on is
stuffed with nothing but the <i>whiskers</i> of those I have sent to
the other world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Vernon’s skill in the invention of marvellous stories has
never been surpassed, even by the peddlers of wooden nutmegs.
Talking one day about the intense heat of the sun in India, he
remarked that it was a common thing there for people to be
charred to powder by a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de soleil</span></i>, and that upon one occasion,
while dining with a Hindoo, one of his host’s wives was
suddenly reduced to ashes, whereupon the Hindoo rang the bell,
and said to the attendant who answered it, “Bring fresh
glasses, and <i>sweep up your mistress</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another of his stories was this. He happened to be shooting
hyenas near Carthage, when he stumbled, and fell down an
abyss of many fathoms’ depth. He was surprised, however, to
find himself unhurt; for he lighted as if on a feather bed.
Presently he perceived that he was gently moved upward; and,
having by degrees reached the mouth of the abyss, he again
stood safe on terra firma. He had fallen upon an immense
mass of bats, which, disturbed from their slumbers, had risen
out of the abyss and brought him up with them.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CHARLES MATHEWS AND THE SILVER SPOON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Soon after Mathews went from York to the Haymarket Theatre,
he was invited with other performers to dine with Mr.
A——, afterwards an eminent silversmith, but who at that
period followed the business of a pawnbroker. It so happened
that A—— was called out of the parlor, at the back of the
shop, during dinner. Mathews, with wonderful celerity, altering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>his hair, countenance, hat, &amp;c., took a large gravy-spoon
off the dinner-table, ran instantly into the street, entered one
of the little dark doors leading to the pawnbroker’s counter,
and actually pledged to the unconscious A—— his own gravy-spoon.
Mathews contrived with equal rapidity to return and
seat himself (having left the street-door open) before A——
reappeared at the dinner-table. As a matter of course, this
was made the subject of a wager. An <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclaircissement</span></i> took
place before the party broke up, to the infinite astonishment
of A——.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A ROYAL QUANDARY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>On the first consignment of Seidlitz Powders to the capital
of Delhi, the monarch was deeply interested in the accounts of
the refreshing beverage. A box was brought to the king in
full court, and the interpreter explained to his majesty how it
was to be used. Into a goblet he put the contents of the
twelve blue papers; and, having added water, the king drank
it off. This was the alkali, and the royal countenance exhibited
no sign of satisfaction. It was then explained that in the
<i>combination</i> of the two powders lay the luxury; and the
twelve white powders were quickly dissolved in water, and as
eagerly swallowed by his majesty. With a shriek that will
never be forgotten, the monarch rose, staggered, exploded, and,
in his agony, screamed, “<i>Hold me down!</i>” Then, rushing from
the throne, he fell prostrate on the floor. There he lay during
the long-continued effervescence of the compound, spirting like
ten thousand pennyworths of imperial pop, and believing
himself in the agonies of death, a melancholy and convincing
proof that kings are mortal.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>RELICS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“What is this?” said a traveller, who entertained reasonable
doubts as to the genuineness of certain so-called relics of
antiquity, while visiting an old cathedral in the Netherlands:
“what is contained in this phial?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>“Sir,” replied the sacristan, “that phial contains one of the
frogs picked up when Pharaoh was visited with the plague of
frogs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure, then,” rejoined the traveller, “there could have
been no epicures in those days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why so?” said the sacristan.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Because they would have eaten him, he is so large and fat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The traveller took up another phial which was near. “This
contains?” said he,—</p>

at, when a member is employed to corrupt everybody in order
to obtain votes.” Upon this there was a great outcry by
almost everybody in the house. “Who is it?” “Name him!
Name him!” “Sir,” said Sheridan to the Speaker, “I shall
not name the person. It is an unpleasant and invidious thing
to do so; and, therefore, I shall not name him. But don’t suppose,
Sir, that I abstain because there is any difficulty in naming

<h3 class='c012'>A RUSSIAN JESTER AND HIS JOKES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Popular traditions in Russia unite in representing the jester
Balakireff as the constant attendant of Peter the Great, who
figures largely in all the stories attached to the name of his
buffoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one occasion Balakireff begged permission of his imperial
master to attach himself to the guard stationed at the palace,
and Peter, for the sake of the joke, consented—warning him at
the same time that any officer of the guard who happened to
lose his sword, or to be absent from his post when summoned,
was punished with death. The newly-made officer promised to
do his best; but the temptation of some good wine sent to his
quarters that evening by the Czar, “to moisten his commission,”
proved too strong for him; and he partook so freely as to
become completely “screwed.” While he was sleeping off his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>debauch, Peter stole softly into the room, and carried off his
sword. Balakireff missing it on awakening, and frightened
out of his wits at the probable consequences, could devise no
better remedy than to replace the weapon with his own professional
sword of lath,—the hilt and trappings of which were
exactly similar to those of the guardsmen. Thus equipped, he
appeared on parade the next morning, confident in the assurance
of remaining undetected, if not forced to draw his weapon.
But Peter, who had doubtless foreseen this contingency,
instantly began storming at one of the men for his untidy
appearance, and at length faced round upon Balakireff with the
stern order, “Captain Balakireff, draw your sword and cut that
sloven down!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor jester, thus brought fairly to bay, laid his hand on
his hilt as if to obey, but at the same time exclaimed fervently,
“Merciful Heaven! let my sword be turned into wood!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And drawing the weapon, he exhibited in very deed a harmless
lath. Even the presence of the Emperor was powerless to
check the roar of laughter which followed, and Balakireff was
allowed to escape.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>The jester’s ingenuity occasionally served him in extricating
others from trouble as well as himself. A cousin of his, having
fallen under the displeasure of the Czar, was about to be executed;
and Balakireff presented himself at Court to petition
for a reprieve. Peter, seeing him enter, and at once divining
his errand, shouted to him: “It’s no use your coming here; I
swear that I will <i>not</i> grant what you are going to ask!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Quick as thought, Balakireff dropped on his knees, and exclaimed,
“Peter Alexejevitch, I beseech you put that scamp of
a cousin of mine to death!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Peter, thus caught in his own trap, had no choice but to
laugh, and send a pardon to the offender.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>During one of the Czar’s Livonian campaigns, a thick fog
greatly obstructed the movements of the army. At length a
pale watery gleam began to show itself through the mist, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>two of the Russian officers fell to disputing whether this were
the sun or not. Balakireff, happening to pass by at that
moment, they appealed to him to decide. “Is that light yonder
the sun, brother?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How should I know,” answered the jester; “I’ve never
been here before!”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>At the end of the same campaign, several of the officers
were relating their exploits, when Balakireff stepped in among
them. “I’ve got a story to tell, too,” cried he, boastfully; “a
better one than any of yours!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us hear it, then,” answered the officers; and Balakireff
began,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never liked this way of fighting, all in a crowd together,
which they have nowadays; it seems to me more manly for
each to stand by himself; and therefore I always went out
alone. Now it chanced that one day, while reconnoitering
close to the enemy’s outposts, I suddenly espied a Swedish
soldier lying on the ground, just in front of me. There was
not a moment to lose; he might start up and give the alarm.
I drew my sword, rushed upon him, and at one blow cut off
his right foot!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You fool!” cried one of the listeners, “you should rather
have cut off his head!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So I would,” answered Balakireff, with a grin, “but somebody
else had done that already!”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>At times Balakireff pushed his waggeries too far, and gave
serious offense to his formidable patron. On one of these
occasions the enraged Emperor summarily banished him from
the Court, bidding him “never appear on Russian soil again.”
The jester disappeared accordingly; but a week had hardly
elapsed when Peter, standing at his window, espied his disgraced
favorite coolly driving a cart past the very gates of the
palace. Foreseeing some new jest, he hastened down, and
asked with pretended roughness, “How dare you disobey me,
when I forbade you to show yourself on Russian ground?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>“I haven’t disobeyed you,” answered Balakireff, coolly;
“I’m not on Russian ground now!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not on Russian ground?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; this cart-load of earth that I’m sitting on is Swedish
soil. I dug it up in Finland only the other day!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Peter, who had doubtless begun already to regret the loss of
his jester, laughed at the evasion, and restored him to favor.
Some Russian writers embellished this story (a German version
of which figures in the adventures of Tyll Eulenspiegel) with
the addition that Peter, on hearing the excuse, answered, “If
Finland be Swedish soil now, it shall be Russian before long”—a
threat which he was not slow to fulfill.</p>

replied that he was. “I was there,” said the interrogator, “and
I know you by your limp.” “Well,” said the doctor, “it seems

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Jameson, speaking of the mistaken belief that there
are essential masculine and feminine virtues and vices, says it
is not the quality itself, but the modification of the quality,
which is masculine or feminine; and on the manner or degree
in which these are balanced or combined in the individual, depends
the perfection of that individual character. As the influences
of religion are extended and as civilization advances,
those qualities which are now admired as essentially <i>feminine</i>
will be considered as essentially <i>human</i>,—such as gentleness,
purity, the more unselfish and spiritual sense of duty, and the
dominance of the affections over the passions. This is, perhaps,
what Buffon, speaking as a naturalist, meant when he said that
with the progress of humanity <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les races se féminisent</span></i>. The
axiom of the Greek philosopher Antisthenes, the disciple of
Socrates, <i>The virtue of the man and the woman is the same</i>,

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Jameson adds that in all these fifty-six lines there is
only one line which cannot be feminized in its significance,—that
filled up with asterisks, and which is totally at variance
with the ideal of <i>a happy woman</i>. It is the line—</p>

      <div class='line'>And in himself possess his own desire.</div>

</div>

<p class='c000'>No woman could exist happily or virtuously in such complete
independence of all external affections as these words express.
“Her desire is to her husband:” this is the sort of subjection
prophesied for the daughters of Eve. A woman doomed to
exist without this earthly rest for her affections does not “in
herself possess her own desire;” she turns towards God; and,
if she does not make her life a life of worship, she makes it a
life of charity, or she dies a spiritual and a moral death. Is it
much better with the man who concentrates his aspirations in
himself?</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>PARALLEL OF THE SEXES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is an admirable partition of qualities between the
sexes, which the great Author of being has distributed to each
with a wisdom which calls for our admiration. Man is strong,—woman
is beautiful. Man is daring and confident,—woman
is diffident and unassuming. Man is great in action,—woman,
in suffering. Man shines abroad,—woman, at home. Man
talks to convince,—woman, to persuade and please. Man has
a rugged heart,—woman, a soft and tender one. Man prevents
misery,—woman relieves it. Man has science,—woman, taste.
Man has judgment,—woman, sensibility. Man is a being of
justice,—woman, of mercy.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FEMALE SOCIETY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following remarks come with peculiar force from one of
such querulous and unconnubial habits as John Randolph:—</p>

<p class='c000'>You know my opinion of female society: without it we should
degenerate into brutes. This observation applies with tenfold
force to young men, and those who are in the prime of manhood.
For, after a certain time of life, the literary man makes
a shift (a poor one, I grant) to do without the society of ladies.
To a young man nothing is so important as a spirit of devotion
(next to his Creator) to some amiable woman, whose image
may occupy his heart and guard it from the pollution that besets
it on all sides. A man ought to choose his wife as Mrs.
Primrose did her wedding-gown,—for qualities that will “wear
well.” One thing at least is true, that, if matrimony has its
cares, celibacy has no pleasures. A Newton, or a mere scholar,
may find enjoyment in study; a man of literary taste can receive
in books a powerful auxiliary; but a man must have a
bosom friend, and children around him, to cherish and support
the dreariness of old age.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WIFE—MISTRESS—LADY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Who marries for love takes a wife; who marries for convenience
takes a mistress; who marries from consideration takes
a lady. You are loved by your wife, regarded by your mistress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>tolerated by your lady. You have a wife for yourself, a
mistress for your house and its friends, a lady for the world.
Your wife will agree with you, your mistress will accommodate
you, your lady will manage you. Your wife will take care of
your household, your mistress of your house, your lady of appearances.
If you are sick, your wife will nurse you, your
mistress will visit you, your lady will inquire after your health.
You take a walk with your wife, a ride with your mistress, and
join parties with your lady. Your wife will share your grief,
your mistress your money, and your lady your debts. If you
are dead, your wife will shed tears, your mistress lament, and
your lady wear mourning.—<i>From the German.</i></p>

<p class='c013'>That was a thrilling scene in the old chivalric time—the
wine circling around the board, and the banquet-hall ringing
with sentiment and song—when, the lady of each knightly
heart having been pledged by name, St. Leon arose in his

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I drink to one</div>

      <div class='line'>When lighter passions long have passed,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So holy ’tis, and true;</div>
      <div class='line'>To one whose love hath longer dwelt,</div>
      <div class='line'>More deeply fixed, more keenly felt,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Than any pledge to you.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Each guest upstarted at the word,</div>
      <div class='line'>And laid his hand upon his sword,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With fury-flashing eye;</div>

      <div class='line'>Proud knight, of this most peerless dame,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whose love you count so high.”</div>
      <div class='line'>St. Leon paused, as if he would</div>
      <div class='line'>Not breathe her name in careless mood</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus lightly to another,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then bent his noble head, as though</div>

  <h3 class='c012'>LETTER TO A BRIDE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The following letter was written by an old friend to a young
lady on the eve of her wedding day:—</p>

<p class='c000'>I have sent you a few flowers to adorn the dying moments
of your single life. They are the gentlest types of delicate
and durable friendship. They spring up by our side when
others have deserted it; and they will be found watching over
our graves when those who should cherish have forgotten us.
It seems that a past, so calm and pure as yours, should expire
with a kindred sweetness about it,—that flowers and music,
kind friends and earnest words, should consecrate the hour
when a sentiment is passing into a sacrament.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three great stages of our being are the birth, the bridal,
and the burial. To the first we bring only weakness—for the
last we have nothing but dust! But here at the altar, when
life joins life, the pair come throbbing up to the holy man,
whispering the deep promise that arms each other’s heart, to
help on in the life-struggle of care and duty. The beautiful
will be there, borrowing new beauty from the scene. The gay
and thoughtless, with their flounces and frivolities, will look
solemn for once. Youth will come to gaze upon the object
of its secret yearnings; and age will totter up to hear the
words repeated that to their own lives had given the charm.
Some will weep over it as if it were a tomb, and some laugh
over it as if it were a joke; but two must stand by it, for it is
fate, not fun, this everlasting locking of their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now, can you, who have queened it over so many bending
forms, can you come down at last to the frugal diet of a
single heart? Hitherto you have been a clock, giving your
time to all the world. Now you are a watch, buried in one
particular bosom, warming only his breast, marking only his
hours, and ticking only to the beat of his heart—where time
and feeling shall be in unison, until those lower ties are lost in
that higher wedlock, where all hearts are united.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoping that calm and sunshine may hallow your clasped
hands, I sink silently into a signature.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHREWD DECISION OF ALI, CALIPH OF BAGDAD.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the Preliminary Dissertation to Dr. Richardson’s Arabic
Dictionary the following curious anecdote is recorded:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Two Arabians sat down to dinner: one had five loaves, the
other three. A stranger passing by desired permission to eat
with them, which they agreed to. The stranger dined, laid
down eight pieces of money, and departed. The proprietor of
the five loaves took up five pieces and left three for the other,
who objected, and insisted on having one-half. The cause came
before Ali, who gave the following judgment:—“Let the owner
of the five loaves have seven pieces of money, and the owner of
the three loaves one; for, if we divide the eight loaves by three,
they make twenty-four parts; of which he who laid down the
five loaves had fifteen, while he who laid down three had only
nine. As all fared alike, and eight shares was each man’s proportion,
the stranger ate seven parts of the first man’s property,
and only one belonging to the other. The money, in justice,
must be divided accordingly.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE WISDOM OF ALI.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>The Prophet once, sitting in calm debate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Said, “I am Wisdom’s fortress; but the gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Thereof is Ali.” Wherefore, some who heard,</div>
      <div class='line'>With unbelieving jealousy were stirred;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, that they might on him confusion bring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ten of the boldest joined to prove the thing.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Let us in turn to Ali go,” they said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“And ask if Wisdom should be sought instead</div>
      <div class='line'>Of earthly riches; then, if he reply</div>
      <div class='line'>To each of us, in thought, accordantly,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet to none in speech or phrase the same,</div>
      <div class='line'>His shall the honor be, and ours the shame.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, when the first his bold demand did make,</div>
      <div class='line'>These were the words which Ali straightway spake:—</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>“Wisdom is the inheritance of those</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom Allah favors; riches, of his foes.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the second he said:—“Thyself must be</div>
      <div class='line'>Guard to thy riches; but Wisdom guardeth thee.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the third:—“By Wisdom wealth is won;</div>
      <div class='line'>But riches purchased Wisdom yet for none.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the fourth:—“Thy goods the thief may take;</div>
      <div class='line'>But into Wisdom’s house he cannot break.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the fifth:—“Thy goods decrease the more</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou givest; but woe enlarges Wisdom’s store.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the sixth:—“Wealth tempts to evil ways;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the desire of Wisdom is God’s praise.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the seventh:—“Divide thy wealth, each part</div>
      <div class='line'>Becomes a pittance. Give with open heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy wisdom, and each separate gift shall be</div>
      <div class='line'>All that thou hast, yet not impoverish thee.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the eighth:—“Wealth cannot keep itself;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Wisdom is the steward even of pelf.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the ninth:—“The camels slowly bring</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy goods; but Wisdom has the swallow’s wing.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And lastly, when the tenth did question make,</div>
      <div class='line'>These were the ready words which Ali spake:—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Wealth is a darkness which the soul should fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Wisdom is the lamp that makes it clear.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Crimson with shame, the questioners withdrew,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they declared, “The Prophet’s words were true:</div>
      <div class='line'>The mouth of Ali is the golden door</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Wisdom.”</div>
      <div class='line in12'>When his friends to Ali bore</div>
      <div class='line'>These words, he smiled, and said, “And should they ask</div>
      <div class='line'>The same until my dying day, the task</div>
      <div class='line'>Were easy; for the stream from Wisdom’s well,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which God supplies, is inexhaustible.”</div>

<h3 class='c012'>MOHAMMEDAN LOGIC.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The laws of Cos discountenance in a very singular manner
any cruelty on the part of females towards their admirers. An
instance occurred while Dr. Clarke and his companions were on
the island, in which the unhappy termination of a love-affair
occasioned a trial for what the Mohammedan lawyers casuistically
describe as “homicide by an intermediate cause.” The
following was the case: a young man desperately in love with
a girl of Stanchis eagerly sought to marry her, but his proposals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>were rejected. In consequence, he destroyed himself by
poison. The Turkish police arrested the father of the obdurate
fair, and tried him for culpable homicide. “If the accused,”
argued they, with much gravity, “had not had a
daughter, the deceased would not have fallen in love; consequently
he would not have been disappointed; consequently he
would not have swallowed poison; consequently he would not
have died;—but the accused had a daughter, the deceased had
fallen in love,” &amp;c. Upon all these counts he was called upon
to pay the price of the young man’s life; and this, being fixed
at the sum of eighty piastres, was accordingly exacted.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Said Omar, “Either these books are in conformity with the
Koran, or they are not. If they are, they are useless, and if
not, they are evil: in either event, therefore, let them be
destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the logic that led to the destruction of seven hundred
thousand manuscript volumes.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TURKISH EXPEDIENTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A Turkish testator left to his eldest son one-half of his
seventeen horses, to his second son one-third, to his third son
one-ninth of his horses. The executor did not know what to
do, as seventeen will neither divide by two, nor by three, nor
by nine. A dervise came up on horseback, and the executor
consulted him. The dervise said, “Take my horse, and add
him to the others.” There were then eighteen horses. The
executor then gave to the eldest son one-half,—nine; to the
second son one-third,—six; to the third son one-ninth,—two:
total, seventeen. The dervise then said, “You don’t want
my horse now; I will take him back again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, as Dr. Young was walking in his garden at Welwyn
in company with two ladies, (one of whom he afterwards married,)
the servant came to acquaint him that a gentleman wished
to speak with him. “Tell him,” said the doctor, “I am too
happily engaged to change my situation.” The ladies insisted
that he should go, as his visitor was a man of rank, his
patron, and his friend. But, as persuasion had no effect, one
took him by the right arm, the other by the left, and led him
to the garden-gate; when, finding resistance in vain, he bowed,
laid his hand upon his heart, and, in that expressive manner
for which he was so remarkable, spoke the following lines:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Like him I go, for angels drove us both.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard was his fate, but mine still more unkind:</div>

<p class='c000'>Ben Jonson having been invited to dine at the Falcon
Tavern, where he was already deeply in debt, the landlord promised
to wipe out the score if he would tell him what God,

be best pleased with. To which the ready poet promptly replied:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line'>God is best pleased when men forsake their sin;</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>Burns, going into church one Sunday and finding it difficult
to procure a seat, was kindly invited by a young lady into her
pew. The sermon being upon the terrors of the law, and the
preacher being particularly severe in his denunciation of sinners,
the lady, who was very attentive, became much agitated.
Burns, on perceiving it, wrote with his pencil, on a blank leaf
of her Bible, the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Fair maid, you need not take the hint,</div>

<p class='c000'>One evening at the King’s Arms, Dumfries, Burns was called
from a party of friends to see an impertinent coxcomb in the
form of an English commercial traveller, who patronizingly invited
the <i>Ayrshire Ploughman</i> to a glass of wine at his table.
Entering into conversation with the <i>condescending</i> stranger,
Burns soon saw what sort of person he had to deal with.
About to leave the room, the poet was urged to give a specimen
of his facility in impromptu versifying, when, having asked the
name and age of the conceited traveller, he instantly penned
and handed him the following stanza,—after which he abruptly
departed:—</p>

<p class='c000'>When Percy first published his collection of Ancient English
Ballads, he was rather lavish in commendation of their beautiful

instance,” said he,—</p>

<p class='c000'>Barty Willard, who formerly lived in the northern part of
Vermont, was noted for his careless, vagabond habits, ready
wit, and remarkable facility at extempore rhyming. Sitting
one day in a village store, among a crowd of idlers who always
gathered about him on his arrival, the merchant asked Barty
“why he always wore that shocking bad hat.” Barty replied
that it was simply because he was unable to purchase a new
one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come,” said the merchant; “make me a good rhyme on
the old hat immediately, without stopping to think, and I’ll
give you the best castor in the store.” Whereupon Barty
threw his old tile on the floor, and began:—</p>

      <div class='line in6'>Here lies my old hat,</div>

<p class='c000'>The new hat was adjudged, by the “unanimous vote of the
house,” to belong to Barty, who wore it off in triumph, saying,
“it was a poor head that couldn’t take care of itself.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>Some years ago a French speculator found himself ruined by
a sudden collapse in the stock-market. He resolved to commit
suicide, but, as he was a connoisseur in monumental literature,
he decided first to compose his own epitaph. The first line—a
very fine one—terminated with the word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">triomphe</span></i>. To this,
search as he might, he could find no rhyme, and he could not
bring himself to sacrifice his beloved line. Time passed, finding
him still in search of his rhyme, assisted by a number of
benevolent friends, but all in vain. One day a promising speculation
presented itself: he seized the opportunity and regained
his fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rhyme so zealously sought has at length been found, and
the epitaph completed. Here it is:—</p>

<p class='c000'>To get a rhyme in English for the word <i>month</i> was quite a
matter of interest with curious people years ago, and somebody
made it out or forced it by making a quatrain, in which a lisping
little girl is described as saying:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——I can get a rhyme for a month.</div>
      <div class='line'>I can thay it now, I thed it wunth!</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another plan was to twist the numeral <i>one</i> into an ordinal.
For instance:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Search through the works of Thackeray—you’ll find a rhyme to month;</div>
      <div class='line'>He tells us of Phil Fogarty, of the fighting onety-oneth!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A parallel lisp is as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You can’t,” says Tom to lisping Bill,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Find any rhyme for month.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“A great mithtake,” was Bill’s reply;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“I’ll find a rhyme at <i>onth</i>.”</div>
    </div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>And</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Among our numerous English rhymes,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They say there’s none to month;</div>
      <div class='line'>I tried and failed a hundred times,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But succeeded the hundred and <i>onth</i>.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But these are hardly fair. The rhyme is good, but the English
is bad. Christina Rosetti has done better in the admirable
book of nursery rhymes which she has published under the
title of <cite>Sing-Song</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In both of these instances, however, the rhymes are evasions
of the real issue. The problem is not to make a word by compounding
two, or distorting one, but to find a word ready-made,
in our unabridged dictionaries that will rhyme properly to
month. We believe there is none. Nor is there a fair rhyme
to the word <i>silver</i>, nor to <i>spirit</i>, nor to <i>chimney</i>. Horace Smith,
one of the authors of the <cite>Rejected Addresses</cite>, once attempted
to make one for chimney on a bet, and he did it in this way:—</p>

these lines:—</p>

    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>has been parodied a hundred times; but it is itself a parody of
Pindar, whose fashion of dividing words in his odes all students
of the classics have abundant occasion to remember. The last
stanza was appended by William Pitt,—a fact not generally
known:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sun, moon, and thou, vain world, adieu,</div>

      <div class='line in14'>niversity of Gottingen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Of these fantastic rhymes, Richard Harris Barham, has given
us the finest examples in the language, in his celebrated “Ingoldsby
Legends.” In the legend “Look at the Clock,” we
have this:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Having once gained the summit, and managed to cross it, he</div>
      <div class='line'>Rolls down the side with uncommon velocity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>This from “The Ghost”:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And, being of a temper somewhat warm,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Would now and then seize upon small occasion,</div>
      <div class='line'>A stick or stool, or anything that round did lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And baste her lord and master most confoundedly.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the “Tragedy” we have one even more whimsical and
comical:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The poor little Page, too, himself got no quarter, but</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Was served the same way,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>And was found the next day</div>
      <div class='line'>With his heels in the air, and his head in the water-butt.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Byron has more than matched any of these in completeness
of rhyme and extent, if we may call it so, of rhyming surface,
and matched even himself in acidity of cynicism, in his
couplet:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“——Ye lords of ladies intellectual,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come tell me, have they not hen-pecked you all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Punch has some very funny samples of eccentric rhymes, of
which the best is one that spells out the final word of a couplet,
the last letter or two, making so many syllables rhyme with the
ending word of the preceding line. Thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Me drunk! the cobbler cried, the devil trouble you,</div>
      <div class='line'>You want to kick up a blest r-o-w,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve just returned from a teetotal party,</div>
      <div class='line'>Twelve on us jammed in a spring c-a-r-t,</div>
      <div class='line'>The man as lectured now, was drunk; why bless ye,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’s sent home in a c-h-a-i-s-e.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Twenty-five years or more ago, in Boston, Monday was the
gathering time for Universalist clergymen, Tompkins’ book
store being the place of rendezvous. At these unions, King,
Chapin, Hosea Ballou, Whittemore, and other notabilities, were
pretty sure to be present; and as it was immediately after the
graver labors of the Sabbath, the parsons were apt to be in an
unusually frisky condition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>Chapin, ordinarily, is of reticent habit; but when the company
is congenial, and he is in exhilarant mood, his wonderful flow
of language and quick perception make him a companion rarely
equalled for wit and repartee. On one occasion, when King and
Chapin, and a dozen other clergymen were at Tompkins’s, as was
their wont, Chapin began to rhyme upon the names of those
present. Without a moment’s hesitation, he ran off the name
of each, rhyming it in verse, to the huge delight of the company.
Finally, after exhausting that list, the names of absent
clergymen were given to the ready poet, and there was not a
single failure. At last a clergyman said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can give you a name, Brother Chapin, to which you
cannot make a rhyme.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brother Brimblecomb.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Without a moment’s pause, Chapin said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was a man in our town,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His name—they called it Brimblecomb;</div>
      <div class='line'>He stole the tailor’s needle and shears,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But couldn’t make the thimble come.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Butler’s facility in overcoming stubborn words is amusing.

<p class='c013'>The following love-letter, dated in 1661, was sent by Philip,
second Earl of Chesterfield, to Lady Russell:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Madam:—The dullness of this last cold season doth afford nothing that
is new to divert you; only here is a report that I fain would know the
truth of, which is, that I am extremely in love with you. Pray let me
know if it be true or no, since I am certain that nothing but yourself can
rightly inform me; for if you intend to use me favorably, and do think I
am in love with you, I most certainly am so; but if you intend to receive
me coldly, and do not believe that I am in love, I also am sure that I am
not; therefore let me entreat you to put me out of a doubt which makes
the greatest concern of,</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>A colored man living in Detroit had long admired a colored
widow in a neighboring street, but being afraid to reveal his
passion, went to a white man and asked him to write the lady
a letter asking her hand in marriage. The friend wrote, telling
the woman in a few brief lines that the size of her feet was the
talk of the neighborhood, and asking her if she couldn’t pare
them down a little. The name of the colored man was signed,
and he was to call on her for an answer. Subsequently the writer
of the letter met the negro limping along the street, and asked
him what the widow said. The man showed him a bloodshot
eye, a scratched nose, a lame leg, and a spot on the scalp where a
handful of wool had been violently jerked out; and he answered
in solemn tones: “She didn’t say nuffin, an’ I didn’t stay dar
mor’n a minute!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The following petition, signed by sixteen maids of Charleston,
South Carolina, was presented to the Governor of that
province in March, 1733, “the day of the feast”:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>To His Excellency Governor Johnson.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The humble petition of all the Maids whose names are underwritten:—<i>Whereas</i>,
We the humble petitioners are at present in
a very melancholy disposition of mind, considering how all the
bachelors are blindly captivated by widows, and our more youthful
charms thereby neglected: the consequence of this our request
is, that your Excellency will for the future order that no
Widow shall presume to marry any young man till the maids are
provided for; or else to pay each of them a fine for satisfaction,
for invading our liberties; and likewise a fine to be laid on all
such bachelors as shall be married to widows. The great disadvantage
it is to us maids, is, that the widows, by their forward
carriages, do snap up the young men; and have the vanity to
think their merits beyond ours, which is a great imposition
upon us who ought to have the preference.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is humbly recommended to your Excellency’s consideration,
and hope you will prevent any farther insults.</p>

<p class='c000'>And we poor Maids as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. S.—I, being the oldest maid, and therefore most concerned,
do think it proper to be the messenger to your Excellency
in behalf of my fellow subscribers.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>A MALADROIT PETITION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>An autograph of Madame de Maintenon has recently been
discovered at Chateau-Guinon, the history of which is curious.
A worthy priest of Cuiseaux, a small <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commune</span></i> of La Brasse,
desiring to repair his church, which was becoming dilapidated,
had the happy idea of addressing himself to Madame de Maintenon,
whose charitable bounty was upon every tongue. Not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>being in the habit of corresponding with the great, the style of
his supplication cost him much thought, but at last he produced
a memorial commencing as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Madame:—You enjoy the reputation, which I doubt not is
well founded, of according your favors to all who solicit them.
I therefore venture to appeal to your bounty in behalf of the
church of Cuiseaux,” etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The exalted lady had no sooner cast her eyes upon the poor
priest’s unlucky exordium, than she flew into a rage, and had
him thrown into prison, whence it was with great difficulty that
his friends procured a release. The story seems apocryphal,
but the memorial bears the following indorsement in the handwriting
of Madame de Maintenon:—The lieutenant of police
is ordered to issue a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lettre-de-cachet</span></i> against the signer of this
petition.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><i>Consistency a Jewel.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the search for the source of familiar quotations, none
appears to have so completely baffled patient seekers as the
phrase “Consistency is a jewel.” Several years ago a perplexed
scholar offered a handsome reward for the discovery
of its origin. Not till quite recently, however, has the claim
been set up that the original was found in the “Ballad of
Jolly Robyn Roughhead,” which is preserved in “<cite>Murtagh’s
Collection of Ancient English and Scottish Ballads</cite>.” The
stanza in which it occurs is the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tush, tush, my lassie, such thoughts resign,</div>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Cleanliness next to Godliness.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The origin of the proverb, “Cleanliness is next to godliness,”
has been the subject of extended investigation. Bartlett’s
“Familiar Quotations” attributes the phrase to Rev.
John Wesley; but as this prominent Methodist clergyman uses
this sentence in his sermons as a quotation from some other
work, it has been suggested that further search is requisite.
Rev. Dr. A. S. Bettelheimer, of Richmond, Va., asserts that
he has discovered this maxim in an abstract of religious principles
contained in an old commentary on the Book of Isaiah.
Thus the practical doctrines of religion are resolved into carefulness,
vigorousness, guiltlessness, abstemiousness and cleanliness.
And cleanliness is next to godliness, which is next to holiness.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>He’s a brick.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>An Eastern prince visited the ruler of a neighboring country,
and after viewing various objects worthy of attention, asked to
see the fortifications. He was shown the troops with this
remark—“These are my fortifications; every man is a brick.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'><i>When you are at Rome do as the Romans do.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This proverb has been traced to a saying of St. Ambrose.
St. Augustine mentions in one of his letters (<cite>Ep.</cite> lxxxvj <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
Casulan</span></i>.) that when his mother was living with him at Milan,
she was much scandalized because Saturday was kept there as
a festival; whilst at Rome, where she had resided a long time,
it was kept as a fast. To ease her mind he consulted the
bishop on this question, who told him he could give him no
better advice in the case than to do as he himself did. “For
when I go to Rome,” said Ambrose, “I fast on the Saturday,
as they do at Rome; when I am here, I do not fast.” With
this answer, he says that “he satisfied his mother, and ever after
looked upon it as an oracle sent from heaven.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>In Morton’s clever comedy, <cite>Speed the Plough</cite>, the first
scene of the first act opens with a view of a farm-house, where
Farmer Ashfield is discovered at a table with his jug and pipe,
holding the following colloquy with his wife, Dame Ashfield,
who figures in a riding-dress, with a basket under her arm:—</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Ashfield</i>—Well, Dame, welcome whoam. What news does thee bring
vrom market?</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Dame.</i>—What news husband? What I always told you; that Farmer
Grundy’s wheat brought five shillings a quarter more than ours did.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Ash.</i>—All the better vor he.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Dame.</i>—Ah! the sun seems to shine on purpose for him.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Ash.</i>—Come, come, missus, as thee has not the grace to thank God for
prosperous times, dan’t thee grumble when they be unkindly a bit.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Dame.</i>—And I assure you Dame Grundy’s butter was quite the crack of
the market.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>Ash.</i>—Be quiet woolye? always ding, dinging Dame Grundy into my

<h3 class='c012'><i>So much the worse for the facts.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>M. Royer Collard disapproved of the opinions of the Fathers
of Port Royal on the doctrine of grace: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Ils ont les textes pour

to Voltaire.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Conspicuous by its absence.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Earl Russell, in an address to the electors of the city of
London, alluding to Lord Derby’s Reform Bill, which had just
been defeated, said:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Among the defects of the Bill, which were numerous, one provision was
conspicuous by its presence, and one by its absence.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of a speech subsequently delivered at a meeting
of Liberal electors at the London Tavern, he justified his use
of these words thus:—</p>

<p class='c018'>It has been thought that by a misnomer or a bull on my part I alluded
to it as “a provision conspicuous by its absence,” a turn of phraseology
which is not an original expression of mine, but is taken from one of the
greatest historians of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The historian referred to is Tacitus, who, (<cite>Annals</cite>, iii. 761)
speaking of the images carried in procession at the funeral of
Junia, says: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed præfulgebant Cassius atque Brutus eo ipso
quod effigies eorum non videbantur</span></i>. Russell’s adaptation recalls
the “brilliant flashes of silence” which Sydney Smith
attributed to Macaulay. Since the Jesuits succeeded in causing
the lives of Arnauld and Pascal to be excluded from <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Histoire

de tout crime quand ils ont dit, <i>Faites ce que nous disons et ne
faites pas ce que nous faisons</i>.</span>” The germ of the words thus
put into the mouths of the friars of his day, Boccacio no doubt
found in the language of our Saviour recorded in Matthew
xxiii. 2, 3:—“The scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat; all

divine, guided by the light of mathematics purely his own, first demonstrated
the motions and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, and the
causes of the tides; who discovered, what before his time no one had ever
suspected, that the rays of light are differently refrangible, and that this is
the cause of colors; and who was a diligent, penetrating, and faithful interpreter
of nature, antiquity, and the sacred writings. In his philosophy, he
maintained the majesty of the Supreme Being; in his manners, he expressed
the simplicity of the Gospel. Let mortals congratulate themselves that the
world has seen so great and excellent a man, the glory of human nature.</p>

was placed in a beautiful sarcophagus of white marble, from a
quarry in Chester county, Pennsylvania, and prepared in Philadelphia
by the gentleman who presented it. The lid is
wrought with the arms of the country and the inscription here
appended. Independently of other considerations, it is desirable,
for the honor of the nation so largely indebted to Washington,
that his grave should be something more than an advertising
medium for a marble-mason. But the faithful chronicler
must take things as he finds them, not always as they
should be:—</p>

    <div>this sarcophagus</div>

<p class='c000'>The stone and the inscription over the grave of Franklin
and his wife, at the corner of Fifth and Arch Streets, Philadelphia,
and recently opened to public view by substituting for
the old brick wall a neat iron railing, are according to his own
direction in his will. The exceeding plainness of both are
strikingly characteristic of the man. The stone is a simple
marble slab, six feet by four, lying horizontally, and raised
about a foot above the ground. It bears the following:—</p>

<p class='c000'>That this well-known typographical inscription was plagiarized
from Mather’s <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnalia Christi Americana</span></cite>, is evident
from Franklin’s own admission of his familiarity with the
works of “the great Cotton.” To the perusal in early life of
Mather’s excellent volume, <cite>Essays to do Good</cite>, published in
1710, Franklin ascribed all his “usefulness in the world.”

by Benjamin Woodbridge, a member of the first graduating
class of Harvard University, 1642:—</p>

who died December 22d, 1828, aged 61. Her face was fair, her person

the wants of her fellow-creatures, and cultivated that divine pleasure by the
most liberal and unpretending methods. To the poor she was a benefactress;
to the rich she was an example; to the wretched a comforter; to the prosperous
an ornament. Her pity went hand in hand with her benevolence; and
she thanked her Creator for being permitted to do good. A being so gentle
and yet so virtuous, slander might wound, but could not dishonor. Even
death, when he tore her from the arms of her husband, could but transplant
her to the bosom of her God.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert Baxter of Farhouse, who died in 1796, was believed
to have been poisoned by a neighbor with whom he had a
violent quarrel. Baxter was well known to be a man of voracious
appetite; and it seems that one morning, on going out to
the fell, he found a piece of bread and butter wrapped in
white paper. This he incautiously devoured, and died a few
hours after in great agony. The following is inscribed on his
tombstone, Knaresdale, Northumberland:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Christopher North, speaking of the celebrated epitaph written
by Simonides and graved on the monument erected in
commemoration of the battle of Thermopylæ, says:—The oldest
and best inscription is that on the altar-tomb of the Three

eighteen English versions. Start not: it is but two lines; and
all Greece, for centuries, had them by heart. She forgot them,
and “Greece was living Greece no more!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>The following singular inscription may be seen on a monument
in Horsley Down Church, Cumberland, England:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c015'>
    <div>Here lie the bodies of</div>
    <div>Thomas Bond and Mary his wife.</div>
    <div>She was temperate, chaste, and charitable.</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>She was proud, peevish, and passionate.</div>
    <div>She was an affectionate wife and a tender</div>
    <div>mother,</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>Her husband and child, whom she loved, seldom</div>
    <div>saw her countenance without a</div>
    <div>disgusting frown;</div>
    <div>Whilst she received visitors whom she despised</div>
    <div>with an endearing smile.</div>
    <div>Her behaviour was discreet towards strangers,</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>Imprudent in her family.</div>
    <div>Abroad her conduct was influenced by good</div>
    <div>breeding,</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>At home by ill temper.</div>
    <div>She was a professed enemy to flattery, and was</div>
    <div>seldom known to praise or commend;</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>The talents in which she principally excelled</div>
    <div>Were difference of opinion and discovering</div>
    <div>flaws and</div>
    <div>Imperfections.</div>
    <div>She was an admirable economist,</div>
    <div>And, without prodigality,</div>
    <div>Dispensed plenty to every person in her family,</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>Would sacrifice their eyes to a farthing candle.</div>
    <div>She sometimes made her husband</div>
    <div>Happy with her good qualities,</div>
    <div>But</div>
    <div>Much more frequently miserable with her</div>
    <div>Many failings.</div>
    <div>Insomuch that in thirty years’ cohabitation,</div>
    <div>He often lamented that,</div>
    <div>Maugre all her virtues,</div>
    <div>He had not on the whole enjoyed two years</div>
    <div>Of matrimonial comfort.</div>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>At length,</div>
    <div>Finding she had lost the affection of her husband,</div>
    <div>as well as the regard of her neighbors,</div>
    <div>family disputes having been</div>
    <div>divulged by servants,</div>
    <div>She died of vexation, July 20, 1768,</div>
    <div>Aged 48 years.</div>
    <div>Her worn-out husband survived her four months</div>
    <div>and two days, and departed this life</div>
    <div>November 22, 1768,</div>
    <div>In the 54th year of his age.</div>
    <div>William Bond, brother to the deceased,</div>
    <div>Erected this stone as a</div>
    <div>Weekly monitor to the wives of this parish,</div>
    <div>That they may avoid the infamy of having</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’m amazed at the signs</div>
      <div class='line'>As I pass through the town.</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the odd mixture,—</div>
      <div class='line'>A <i>magpye</i> and <i>crown</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>whale</i> and the <i>crow</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>razor</i> and <i>hen</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>leg</i> and <i>seven stars</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>axe</i> and the <i>bottle</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>tun</i> and the <i>lute</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>eagle</i> and <i>child</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>The <i>shovel</i> and <i>boot</i>.—<cite>British Apollo, 1710.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The absurdities which tavern-signs present are often curious
enough, but may in general be traced to that inveterate propensity
which the vulgar of all countries have, to make havoc with
every thing in the shape of a proper name. What a <i>magpie</i>
could have to do with a <i>crown</i>, or a <i>whale</i> with a <i>crow</i>, or a
<i>hen</i> with a <i>razor</i>, it is as difficult to conjecture as to trace the
corruption of language in which the connection more probably
originated. The sign of the <i>leg</i> and the <i>seven stars</i> was merely
an orthographical deviation from the <i>league</i> and <i>seven stars</i>, or
seven united provinces; and the <i>axe</i> and <i>bottle</i> was, doubtless,
a transposition of the <i>battle-axe</i>, a most appropriate sign for
warlike times. The <i>tun</i> and <i>lute</i> formed suitable emblems
enough of the pleasures of wine and music. The <i>eagle</i> and
<i>child</i>, too, had meaning, though no application; but when we
come to the <i>shovel</i> and <i>boot</i>, nonsense again triumphs, and it is
in vain that we look for any rational explanation of the affinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>Swan-with-two-necks</i> has long been an object of mystery
to the curious. This mystery is solved by the alteration of a
single letter. The sign, as it originally stood, was the <i>swan
with two nicks</i>; the meaning of which we find thus explained
in a communication made by the late Sir Joseph Banks to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>Antiquarian Society. Sir Joseph presented to the Society a
curious parchment roll, exhibiting the marks, or nicks, made
on the beaks of swans and cygnets in all the rivers and lakes
in Lincolnshire, accompanied with an account of the privileges
of certain persons keeping swans in these waters, and the duties
of the king’s swanherd in guarding these fowls from depredation
and preventing any two persons from adopting the same
figures or marks on the bills of their swans. The number of
marks contained in the parchment roll amounted to two hundred
and nineteen, all of which were different and confined to
the small extent of the bill of the swan. The outlines were an
oblong square, circular at one end, and containing dots, notches,
arrows, or suchlike figures, to constitute the difference in each
man’s swans. Laws were enacted so late as the 12th of Elizabeth,
for the preservation of the swans in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>goat and compasses</i> has been supposed to have its origin
in the resemblance between the bounding of a goat and the
expansion of a pair of compasses; but nothing can be more
fanciful. The sign is of the days of the Commonwealth, when
it was fashionable to give scriptural names to every thing and
everybody, and when <i>God-be-praised Barebones</i> preferred
drinking his tankard of ale at the <i>God-encompasseth-us</i> to anywhere
else. The corruption from <i>God-encompasseth-us</i> to <i>goat
and compasses</i> is obvious and natural enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Richard Flecknoe’s <cite>Enigmatical Characters</cite>, published
1665, speaking of the “fanatic reformers,” (the Puritans,) he
observes, “As for the <span class='fss'>SIGNS</span>, they have pretty well begun their
reformation already, changing the sign of the <i>salutation of the
angel and our lady</i> into the <i>soldier and citizen</i>, and the <i>Katherine
Wheel</i> into the <i>cat and wheel</i>; so as there only wants then
making the <i>dragon</i> to kill <i>St. George</i>, and the <i>devil</i> to tweak
<i>St. Dunstan</i> by the nose, to make the reformation complete.
Such ridiculous work they make of their reformation, and so
zealous are they against all mirth and jollity, as they would
pluck down the sign of the <i>cat and fiddle</i> too, if it durst but
play so loud as they might hear it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>The cat and fiddle is a a corruption of Caton fidele.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>bag of nails</i>, at Chelsea, is claimed by the smiths
and carpenters of the neighborhood as a house designed for
their peculiar accommodation; but, had it not been for the corruption
of the times, it would still have belonged to the <i>bacchanals</i>,
who, in the time of Ben Jonson, used to take a
holiday stroll to this delightful village. But the old inscription
<i>satyr and bacchanals</i> is now converted into Satan and bag
o’nails.</p>

<p class='c000'>The origin of the <i>chequers</i>, which is so common an emblem
of public houses, has been the subject of much learned conjecture.
One writer supposes that they were meant to represent
that the game of draughts might be played there; another has
been credibly informed that in the reign of Philip and Mary
the then Earl of Arundel had a grant to license public-houses,
and, part of the armorial bearings of that noble family being a
chequer-board, the publican, to show that he had a license, put
out that mark as part of his sign. But, unfortunately for both
solutions, unfortunately for the honors of Arundel, Sir W.
Hamilton presented, some time ago, to the Society of Antiquaries,
a view of a street in Pompeii, in which we find that
shops with the sign of the chequers were common among the
Romans! The real origin of this emblem is still involved in
obscurity. The wittiest, though certainly not the most genuine,
explanation of it was that of the late George Selwyn, who
used to wonder that antiquaries should be at any loss to discover
why <i>draughts</i> were an appropriate emblem for <i>drinking-houses</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>An annotator on Beloe’s <cite>Anecdotes of Literature</cite> says, “I
remember, many years ago, passing through a court in Rosemary
Lane, where I observed an ancient sign over the door of
an ale-house, which was called <i>The Four Alls</i>. There was the
figure of a king, and on a label, ‘I rule all;’ the figure of a
priest, motto, ‘I pray for all;’ a soldier, ‘I fight for all;’ and
a yeoman, ‘I pay all.’ About two years ago I passed
through the same thoroughfare, and, looking up for my curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>sign, I was amazed to see a painted board occupy its place,
with these words inscribed:—‘<i>The Four Awls</i>.’ In Whitechapel
road is a public house which has a written sign, ‘<i>The
Grave Morris</i>.’ A painter was commissioned to embody the
inscription; but this painter had not a poet’s eye; he could
not body forth the form of things unknown. In his distress
he applied to a friend, who presently relieved him, and the
painter delineated, as well as he could, ‘<i>The Graafe Maurice</i>,’
often mentioned in the ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epistolæ Hoelinæ</span></i>’”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Queer Door is corrupted from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cœur Doré</span> (Golden
Heart); the Pig and Whistle, from Peg and Wassail-Bowl; the
Goat in the Golden Boots, from the Dutch Goed in der Gooden
Boote (the god—Mercury—in the golden boots).</p>

<p class='c000'>Many signs are heraldic and represent armorial bearings.
The White Heart was peculiar to Richard II.; the White
Swan to Henry IV. and Edward III.; the Blue Boar to Richard
III.; the Red Dragon to the Tudors; the Bull, the Falcon,
and the Plume of Feathers to Edward IV.; the Swan and
Antelope to Henry V.; the Greyhound and Green Dragon to
Henry VII.; the Castle, the Spread Eagle, and the Globe
were probably adopted from the arms of Spain, Germany, and
Portugal, by inns which were the resort of merchants from
those countries. Many commemorate historical events; others
derive their names from some eminent and popular man.
The Coach and Horses indicated post-houses; the Fox and
Goose denoted the games played within; the Hare and Hounds,
the vicinity of hunting-grounds. In the Middle Ages, a bush
was always suspended in front of the door of a wine-shop,—whence
the saying, “Good wine needs no bush.” Some of
the mediæval signs are still retained, as the Pilgrim, Cross-Keys,
Seven Stars, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is a literal copy of the sign of a small public
house in the village of Folkesworth, near Stilton, Hants. It
contains as much poetry as perhaps the rustic Folkesworth folks
are worth; and doubtless they think it (in the Stilton vernacular)
“quite the cheese.”</p>

prison, left the following memorial on the windows of his cell.
On one pane of glass he wrote:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That which the world miscalls a jail,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A private closet is to me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Whilst a good conscience is my bail,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And innocence my liberty.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On another square he wrote, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mutare vel timere sperno</span></i>, and
on a third pane, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sed victa Catoni</span></i>.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A Mr. Barton, on retiring with a fortune made in the wool-trade,
built a fair stone house at Holme, in Nottinghamshire,
in the window of which was the following couplet,—an humble
acknowledgment of the means whereby he had acquired his
estate:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

  <h3 class='c012'>FRANCKE’S ENCOURAGING DISCOVERY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is said that when Francke was engaged in the great work
of erecting his world-known Orphan-House at Halle, for the
means of which he looked to the Lord in importunate prayer
from day to day, an apparently accidental circumstance made
an abiding impression on him and those about him. A workman,
in digging a part of the foundation, found a small silver
coin, with the following inscription:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jehova, Conditor, Condita Coronide Coronet.</span>”</div>

all due honors at his tomb, he entreats that he may obtain a sight of him.
The hero grants his poet’s petition, and rises in a glorious suit of armor,
which cast so insufferable a splendor that Homer lost his eyes while he
gazed for the enlargement of his notions.</p>

<p class='c000'>has the following remark. “Some future Dr. Farmer may, perhaps,
show how Shakspeare became acquainted with this passage,
without being able to read the original; for the resemblance
is too close to be accidental. But this, with many other
passages, and especially his original Latinisms of phrase, give
evidence enough of a certain degree of acquaintance with
Latin,—doubtless not familiar nor scholar-like, but sufficient to
give a coloring to his style, and to open to him many treasures
of poetical thought and diction not accessible to the merely
English reader. Such a degree of acquirement might well
appear low to an accomplished Latinist like Ben Jonson, and
authorize him to say of his friend,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek;—</div>
    </div>

<p class='c000'>yet the very mention of his ‘small Latin’ indicates that Ben
knew that he had some.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fox, the orator, remarked on one occasion that Shakspeare
must have had some acquaintance with Euripides, for he
could trace resemblances between passages of their dramas:
e.g. what Alcestis in her last moments says about her servants
is like what the dying Queen Katharine (in <cite>Henry the Eighth</cite>)
says about hers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>That Shakspeare “may often be tracked in the snow” of

      <div class='line'>(From the sublime to the ridiculous there is but a step.)</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This saying, commonly ascribed to <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>, was borrowed
by him from <span class='sc'>Tom Paine</span>, whose works were translated into
French in 1791, and who says,—</p>

<p class='c018'>The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related that it is difficult
to class them separately. One step above the sublime makes the ridiculous,
and one step above the ridiculous makes the sublime again.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tom Paine, in turn, adopted the idea from <span class='sc'>Hugh Blair</span>,
who says, in one place,—</p>

<p class='c018'>It is indeed extremely difficult to hit the precise point where true wit ends
and buffoonery begins.</p>

<p class='c000'>In another,—</p>

<p class='c018'>It frequently happens that where the second line is sublime, the third, in
which he meant to rise still higher, is perfect bombast.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, <span class='sc'>Blair</span> borrowed the saying from <span class='sc'>Longinus</span>, a celebrated
Greek critic and rhetorical writer, who, in a Treatise
<cite>On the Sublime</cite>, uses the same expression, with this slight modification,
that he makes the transition a gradual one, while
Blair, Paine, and Napoleon make it but a step.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The resemblance of these lines to the following passage from

striking that we are inclined to regard them as a paraphrase:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Let me then be the most feeble creature alive, so long as that feebleness
serves to invigorate the energies of my rational and immortal spirit, so long
as in that obscurity in which I am enveloped the light of Divine Presence
more clearly shines. Then in proportion as I am weak, I shall be invincibly
strong; and in proportion as I am blind, I shall more clearly see. Oh that I
may thus be perfected by feebleness, and irradiated by obscurity! And indeed
in my blindness I enjoy in no inconsiderable degree the favor of the
Deity, who regards me with more tenderness and compassion in proportion
as I am able to behold nothing but himself. Alas for him who insults me,
<i>who maligns and merits public execration</i>! For the divine law not only
shields me from injury, but almost renders me too sacred to attack,—not
indeed so much from the privation of my sight, as from the overshadowing
of those heavenly wings which seem to have occasioned this obscurity, and
which, when occasioned, he is wont to illuminate with an interior light
more precious and more pure.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BOLD PLAGIARISM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Charles Reade, in <cite>The Wandering Heir</cite> reproduces Swift’s
<cite>Journal of a Modern Lady</cite> in a singular manner. Compare
them. Reade says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mistress Anne Gregory held bad cards; she had to pawn ring after
ring—for these ladies, being well acquainted with each other, never played
on parole—and she kept bemoaning her bad luck. ‘Betty, I knew how
’twould be. The parson called to-day. This odious chair, why will you
stick me in it? Stand farther, girl, I always lose when you look on.’
Mrs. Betty tossed her head, and went behind another lady. Miss Gregory
still lost, and had to pawn her snuff box to Lady Dace. She consoled
herself by an insinuation: ‘My Lady you touched your wedding-ring.
That was a sign to your partner here.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“’Nay Madam, ’twas but a sign my finger itched. But, if you go to
that, you spoke a word began with H. Then she knew you had the king
of hearts.’</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>“‘That is like Miss here,’ said another matron; ‘she rubs her chair when
she hath matadore in hand.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Set a thief to catch a thief, Madam,’ was Miss’s ingenious and polished
reply.</p>

<p class='c018'>“‘Heyday!’ cries one, ‘Here spadillo got a mark on the back; a child
might know it in the dark. Mistress Pigot, I wish you’d be pleased to pare
your nails.’</p>

<p class='c018'>“In short, they said things to each other all night, the slightest of which,
among men, would have filled Phœnix Park next morning with drawn
swords; but it went for little here; they were all cheats, and knew it, and
knew the others knew it, and didn’t care.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was four o’clock before they broke up, huddled on their cloaks and

<h3 class='c012'>HISTORICAL SIMILITUDES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In Motley’s <cite>Rise of the Dutch Republic</cite> is narrated the following
incident:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A bishop’s indiscretion, however, neutralized the apostolic
blows of the major (Charles the Hammer). The pagan Radbod
had already immersed one of his royal legs in the baptismal
font when a thought struck him. “Where are my dead forefathers
at present?” he said, turning suddenly upon Bishop
Wolfrau. “In hell, with all other unbelievers,” was the imprudent
answer. “Mighty well,” replied Radbod, removing his
leg; “then will I rather feast with my ancestors in the halls
of Woden than dwell with your little starveling band of
Christians in heaven.” Entreaties and threats were unavailing.
The Frisian declined positively a rite which was to cause an
eternal separation from his buried kindred, and he died as he
had lived, a heathen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kingsley, in his <cite>Hypatia</cite>, in completing the history of the
Goth Wulf, after his settlement in Spain, writes as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Wulf died as he had lived, a heathen. Placidia, who loved
him well—as she loved all righteous and noble souls—had succeeded
once in persuading him to accept baptism. Adolf himself
acted as one of his sponsors; and the old warrior was in
the act of stepping into the font, when he turned suddenly to
the bishop and asked, “Where were the souls of his heathen
ancestors?” “In hell,” replied the worthy prelate. Wulf drew
back from the font, and threw his bear-skin cloak around him....
He would prefer, if Adolf had no objection, to go to his
own people. And so he died unbaptized, and went to his own.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>This has suggested the query whether Mr. Kingsley uses his
privilege as a novelist to make a distant historical event subserve
the purposes of fiction, or whether this curious incident
occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Francis Parkman in his <cite>Jesuits in North America in
the Seventeenth Century</cite>, notes a corresponding unwillingness
on the part of the Indians to separate from their own kindred
and people:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The body cared for, he next addressed himself to the soul.
“This life is short and very miserable. It matters little whether
we live or die.” The patient remained silent, or grumbled his
dissent. The Jesuit, after enlarging for a time in broken Huron
on the brevity and nothingness of mortal weal or woe, passed
next to the joys of heaven and the pains of hell, which he set
forth with his best rhetoric. His pictures of infernal fires and
torturing devils were readily comprehended, if the listener had
consciousness enough to comprehend anything; but with respect
to the advantages of the French paradise he was slow of conviction.
“I wish to go where my relations and ancestors have
gone,” was a common reply. “Heaven is a good place for
Frenchmen,” said another; “but I wish to be among Indians,
for the French will give me nothing to eat when I get there.”
Often the patient was stolidly silent; sometimes he was hopelessly
perverse and contradictory. Again nature triumphed over
grace. “Which will you choose,” demanded the priest of a
dying woman, “heaven or hell?” “Hell, if my children are
there, as you say,” returned the mother. “Do they hunt in
heaven, or make war, or go to feasts?” asked an anxious inquirer.
“Oh, no!” replied the father. “Then,” returned the
querist, “I will not go. It is not good to be lazy.” But above
all other obstacles was the dread of starvation in the regions
of the blest. Nor when the dying Indian had been induced at
last to express a desire for Paradise was it an easy matter to
bring him to a due contrition for his sins; for he would deny
with indignation that he had ever committed any. When at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>length, as sometimes happened, all these difficulties gave way,
and the patient had been brought to what seemed to his instructor
a fitting frame for baptism, the priest, with contentment
at his heart, brought water in a cup or in the hollow of his hand,
touched his forehead with the mystic drop, and snatched him
from an eternity of woe. But the convert, even after his baptism,
did not always manifest a satisfactory spiritual condition. “Why
did you baptize that Iroquois?” asked one of the dying neophytes,
speaking of the prisoner recently tortured; “he will
get to heaven before us, and, when he sees us coming, he will
drive us out.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Herodotus tells us (Book III. 118) that after the conspirator
Intaphernes and his family had been imprisoned and held for
execution by order of Darius, the wife of the condemned man
constantly presented herself before the royal palace exhibiting
every demonstration of grief. As she regularly continued this
conduct, her frequent appearance at length excited the compassion
of Darius, who thus addressed her by a messenger:
“Woman, King Darius offers you the liberty of any individual of
your family whom you may most desire to preserve.” After some
deliberation with herself she made this reply: “If the king
will grant me the life of any one of my family, I choose my
brother in preference to the rest.” Her determination greatly
astonished the king; he sent to her therefore a second message
to this effect: “The king desires to know why you have thought
proper to pass over your children and your husband, and to
preserve your brother, who is certainly a more remote connection
than your children, and cannot be so dear to you as your husband.”
She answered: “O king! if it please the deity, I may
have another husband; and if I be deprived of these I may have
other children; but as my parents are both dead, it is certain
that I can have no other brother.” The answer appeared to
Darius very judicious; indeed he was so well pleased with it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>that he not only gave the woman the life of her brother, but
also pardoned her eldest son.</p>

<p class='c000'>A passage in the <cite>Antigone</cite> of Sophocles embodies the same
singular sentiment. Creon forbade the rites of sepulture to
Polynices, after the duel with his brother Eteocles, in which
they were mutually slain, and decreed immediate death to any
one who should dare to bury him. Antigone, their sister, was
detected in the act of burial, and was condemned to be buried
alive for her pious care. In her dangerous situation she goes
on to say:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And thus, my Polynices, for my care</div>
      <div class='line'>Of thee, I am rewarded, and the good</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone shall praise me; for a husband dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor, had I been a mother, for my children</div>
      <div class='line'>Would I have dared to violate the laws—</div>
      <div class='line'>Another husband and another child</div>
      <div class='line'>Might sooth affliction; but, my parents dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>A brother’s loss could never be repaired.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A story of analogous character told by an oriental to Miss
Rogers, is related in her book <cite>Domestic Life in Palestine</cite>, as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>When Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Mahomet Ali, ruled in
Palestine, he sent men into all the towns and villages to gather
together a large army. Then a certain woman of Serfurich sought
Ibrahim Pasha at Akka, and came into his presence bowing
herself before him, and said: “O my lord, look with pity on
thy servant, and hear my prayer. A little while ago there were
three men in my house, my husband, my brother, and my eldest
son. But now behold, they have been carried away to serve in
your army, and I am left with my little ones without a protector.
I pray you grant liberty to one of these men, that he may remain
at home.” And Ibrahim had pity on her and said: “O woman,
do you ask for your husband, for your son, or for your brother?”
And she said: “Oh, my lord, give me my brother.” And he
answered: “How is this, O woman, do you prefer a brother
to a husband or a son?” The woman, who was renowned for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>her wit and readiness of speech, replied in a blank verse
impromptu:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If it be God’s will that my husband perish in your service,</div>
      <div class='line'>I am still a woman, and God may lead me to another husband:</div>
      <div class='line'>If on the battle-field my first-born son should fall,</div>
      <div class='line'>I have still my younger ones, who will in God’s time be like unto him.</div>
      <div class='line'>But oh! my lord, if my only brother should be slain,</div>
      <div class='line'>I am without remedy—for my father is dead and my mother is old,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where should I look for another brother?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Ibrahim was much pleased with the words of the woman,
and said: “O, woman, happy above many is thy brother; he
shall be free for thy word’s sake, and thy husband and thy son
shall be free also.” Then the woman could not speak for joy
and gladness. And Ibrahim said: “Go in peace; let it not be
known that I have spoken with you this day.” Then she rose,
and went her way to her village, trusting in the promise of the
Pasha. After three days, her husband, and son, and brother
returned unto her, saying: “We are free from service by order
of the Pasha, but this matter is a mystery to us.” And all
the neighbors marvelled greatly. But the woman held her
peace, and this story did not become known until Ibrahim’s
departure from Akka, after the overthrow of the Egyptian
goverment in Syria, in 1840.</p>

<p class='c000'>What the husband and the son thought of wifely and
motherly affection when the mystery of their deliverance was
cleared up, is not reported.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>THE TWO STATESMEN.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Hume says (<cite>History of England</cite>):—</p>

<p class='c000'>A little before he (Wolsey) expired (28th November, 1530)
he addressed himself in the following words to Sir William
Kingston, Constable of the Tower, who had him in custody:
“I pray you have me heartily recommended unto his royal
majesty (Henry VIII.), and beseech him on my behalf to call
to his remembrance all matters that have passed between us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>especially with regard to his business with the queen, and then
will he know in his conscience whether I have offended him.
He is a prince of a most royal carriage, and hath a princely
heart; and rather than he will miss or want any part of his
will, he will endanger the one half of his kingdom. I do assure
you that I have often kneeled before him, sometimes three
hours together, to persuade him from his will and appetite, but
could not prevail: had I but served God as diligently as I have
served the king, he would not have given me over in my grey
hairs. But this is the just reward I must receive for my indulgent
pains and study, not regarding my service to God but
only to my prince.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Holinshead says in his famous old <cite>Chronicles</cite>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>This year (1540), in the month of <i>August</i>, Sir <i>James
Hamilton of Finbert</i>, Knight, Controller to the King (James V.
of Scotland), who charged him in the king’s name to go
toward within the castel of <i>Edinburgh</i>, which commandment
he willingly obeyed, thinking himself sure enough, as well by
reason of the good service he had done to the king, specially
in repairing the palaces of <i>Striviling</i> and <i>Linlithgow</i>, as also
that the king had him in so high favour, that he stood in no
fear of himself at all. Nevertheless, shortlie after he was
brought forth to judgement, and convicted in the <i>Tolboth</i> of
<i>Edinburgh</i>, of certain points of treason, laid against him,
which he would never confesse; but that notwithstanding, he
was beheaded in the month of <i>September</i> next insuing, after
that he had liberallie confessed at the place of execution, that
he had never in any jot offended the king’s majesty; and that
his death was yet worthilie inflicted upon him by the Divine
justice, because he had often offended the law of God to please
the prince, thereby to obtain greater countenance with him.
Wherefore he admonished all persons, that moved by his example,
they should rather follow the Divine pleasure than
unjustlie seek the king’s favour, since it is better to please God
than man.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>
  <h4 class='c016'>THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Several parallels to Solomon’s judgment, I. Kings iii. 16–28,
are recorded. One occurs in <cite>Gesta Romanorum</cite>. Three youths,
to decide a question, are desired by their referee, the King of
Jerusalem, to shoot at their father’s dead body. One only
refuses; and to him, as the rightful heir, the legacy is awarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Harleian MS., 4523, we are told of a woman of Pegu,
a province of Burmah, whose child was carried away by an
alligator. Upon its restoration another woman claimed the child.
The judge ordered them to pull for it; the infant cried, and one
instantly quit her hold, to whom the child was awarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same story, substantially, is told in the Pali commentary
on the discourses of Buddha, translated by Rev. R. S. Hardy,
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c018'>A woman who was going to bathe, left her child to play on the banks
of a tank, when a female who was passing that way carried it off. They
both appeared before Buddha, and each declared the child was her own.
The command was therefore given that each claimant should seize the
infant by a leg and an arm, and pull with all her might in opposite directions.
No sooner had they commenced than the child began to scream; when the
real mother, from pity, left off pulling, and resigned her claim to the other.
The judge therefore decided that, as she only had shown true affection,
the child must be hers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suetonius tell us that the Emperor Claudius, when a woman
refused to acknowledge her son, ordered them to be married.
The mother confessed her child at once.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>PRECEDENCY.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The Emperor Charles V. was appealed to, by two women of
fashion at Brussels, to settle the point of precedency between
them, the dispute respecting which had been carried to the greatest
height. Charles, after affecting to consider what each lady
had to say, decided that the greater simpleton of the two should
have the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas</span></i>; in consequence of which judgment the ladies
became equally ready to concede the privilege each had claimed.
Napoleon, on the occurrence of a similar difficulty at a Court
ball supper, based his decision on the question of <i>age</i>. Mr. Hey,
of Leeds, at a dinner-party of gentlemen, made <i>merit</i> the test.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>THE LEGEND OF BETH GELERT.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In F. Johnson’s translation from the Sanscrit, occurs the
following passage:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In Ougein lived a Brahman named Mádhava. His wife, of the
Brahmanical tribe, who had recently brought forth, went to perform
her ablutions, leaving him to take charge of her infant offspring.
Presently a person from the Raja came for the Brahman
to perform for him a <span lang="sa-Latn" xml:lang="sa-Latn">Párrana s’ráddha</span> (a religious rite to all his
ancestors.) When the Brahman saw him, being impelled by
his natural poverty, he thought within himself: If I go not
directly, then some one else will take the <span lang="sa-Latn" xml:lang="sa-Latn">s’ráddha</span>. It is said:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In respect of a thing which ought to be taken, or to be given, or of
a work which ought to be done, and not being done quickly, time drinks up
the spirit thereof.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But there is no one here to take care of the child: what can
I do then? Well: I will go, having set to guard the infant
this weasel, cherished a long time, and in no respect distinguished
from a child of my own. This he did and went.
Shortly afterwards, a black serpent, whilst silently coming near
the child, was killed there, and rent into pieces by the weasel;
who, seeing the Brahman coming home, ran towards him with
haste, his mouth and paws all smeared with blood, and rolled himself
at his feet. The Brahman seeing him in that state, without
reflecting, said, “My son has been eaten by this weasel,” and
killed him: but as soon as he drew near and looked, behold the
child was comfortably sleeping, and the serpent lay killed!
Thereupon the Brahman was overwhelmed with grief.</p>

<p class='c000'>This fable was introduced to give point to the moral:—The
fool who, without knowing the true state of the case, becomes
subject to anger, will find cause for regret. Its similarity to the
well-known Welsh legend is so remarkable that we append
Spencer’s touching ballad.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>ART STORIES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Art has parallel stories of a tragic nature. In the</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>Chapel proud</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Roslin’s chiefs uncoffined lie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each baron, for a sable shroud,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sheathed in his iron panoply,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>stands an exquisite example of Gothic tracery-work, known as
the Apprentice’s Pillar, neighbored by corbels carved with grim,
grotesque human faces. How it came by its name may best be
told as the old dame who acted as cicerone at the beginning of
the present century used to tell it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There ye see it, gentlemen, with the lace-bands winding sae
beautifully roond aboot it. The maister had gane awa to Rome
to get a plan for it, and while he was awa, his ’prentice made a
plan himsel, and finished it. And when the maister cam back
and fand the pillar finished, he was sae enraged that he took a
hammer and killed the ’prentice. There you see the ’prentice’s
face—up there in ae corner wi’ a red gash in the brow, and his
mother greetin’ for him in the corner opposite. And there, in
another corner, is the maister, as he lookit just before he was
hanged; it’s him wi’ a kind o’ ruff roond his face.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same century that the Prince of Orkney founded the
chapel at Roslin, the good people of Stendal employed an architect
of repute to build them one new gate, and entrusted the
erection of a second to his principal pupil. In this case, too,
the aspiring youth proved the better craftsman, and paid the
same penalty; the spot whereon he fell beneath his master’s
hammer being marked to this day by a stone commemorating the
event; and the story goes that yet, upon moonlight nights, the
ghost of the murdered youth may be seen contemplating the
work that brought him to an untimely end, while a weird skeleton
beats with a hammer at the stone he wrought into beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another stone, at Grossmoringen, close by Stendal, tells where
an assistant bell-caster was stabbed by his master because he succeeded
in casting a bell, after the latter had failed in the attempt.
It is a tradition of Rouen that the two rose-windows of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_690'>690</span>cathedral were the work of the master-architect and his pupil,
who strove which of the two should produce the finer window.
Again the man beat the master, and again the master murdered
the man in revenge for his triumph. The transept window of
Lincoln Cathedral was the product of a similar contest, but in
this instance the defeated artist killed himself instead of his
successful rival.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BALLADS AND LEGENDS.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Scott’s ballad of “Wild Darrell” was founded upon a story,
first told by Aubrey, but for which the poet was indebted to
Lord Webb Seymour. An old midwife sitting over her fire one
dark November night was roused by a loud knocking at the
door. Upon opening it she saw a horseman, who told her her
services were required by a lady of rank, and would be paid for
handsomely; but as there were family reasons why the affair
should be kept secret, she must submit to be conducted to her
patient blindfolded. She agreed, allowed her eyes to be bandaged,
and took her place on the pillion. After a journey of many
miles, her conductor stopped, led her into a house, and removed
the bandage. The midwife found herself in a handsome bedchamber,
and in presence of a lady and a ferocious-looking man.
A boy was born. Snatching it from the woman’s arms, the man
threw the babe on the blazing fire; it rolled upon the hearth.
Spite of the entreaties of the horrified midwife, and the piteous
prayers of the poor mother, the ruffian thrust the child under
the grate, and raked the hot coals over it. The innocent accomplice
was then ordered to return whence she came, as she
came; the man who had brought her seeing her home again,
and paying her for her pains.</p>

<p class='c000'>The woman lost no time in letting a magistrate know what
she had seen that November night. She had been sharp enough
to cut a piece out of the bed-curtain, and sew it in again, and to
count the steps of the long staircase she had ascended and
descended. By these means the scene of the infanticide was
identified, and the murderer Darrell, Lord of Littlecote House,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>Berkshire was tried at Salisbury. He escaped the gallows by
bribing the judge, only to break his neck in the hunting-field a
few months afterwards, at a place still known as Darrell’s Stile.
Aubrey places Littlecote in Wiltshire, makes the unhappy mother
the waiting-maid of Darrell’s wife, and concludes his narration
thus: “This horrid action did much run in her (the midwife’s)
mind, and she had a desire to discover it, but knew not where
’twas. She considered with herself the time that she was riding,
and how many miles she might have ridden at that rate in that
time, and that it must be some great person’s house, for the room
was twelve feet high. She went to a justice of the peace, and
search was made—the very chamber found. The knight was
brought to his trial; and, to be short, this judge had this noble
house, park, and manor, and (I think) more, for a bribe to save
his life. Sir John Popham gave sentence according to law, but
being a great person and a favorite, he procured a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolle prosequi</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In Sir Walter’s ballad the midwife becomes a friar of orders
gray, compelled to shrive a dying woman,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A lady as a lily bright,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With an infant on her arm;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The shrift is done, the friar is gone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Blindfolded as he came—</div>
      <div class='line'>Next morning, all in Littlecote Hall</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were weeping for their dame.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was hardly fair to make Darrell worse than he was, by laying
a second murder at his door, merely to give a local habitation
and a name to a Scotch tale of murder that might have been an
adaptation of the Berkshire tragedy.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Somewhere about the beginning of the last century, an
Edinburgh clergyman was called out of his bed at midnight on
the pretext that he was wanted to pray with a person at the
point of death. The good man obeyed the summons without
hesitation, but wished he had not done so, when, upon his
sedan-chair reaching an out-of-the-way part of the city, its
bearers insisted upon his being blindfolded, and cut his protestations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>short by threatening to blow out his brains if he refused
to do their bidding. Like the sensible man he was, he submitted
without further parley, and the sedan moved on again.
By and by, he felt he was being carried up-stairs: the chair
stopped, the clergyman was handed out, his eyes uncovered,
and his attention directed to a young and beautiful lady lying
in bed with an infant by her side. Not seeing any signs of
dying about her, he ventured to say so, but was commanded to
lose no time in offering up such prayers as were fitting for a
person at the last extremity. Having done his office, he was
put into the chair and taken down-stairs, a pistol-shot startling
his ears on the way. He soon found himself safe at home, a
purse of gold in his hand, and his ears still ringing with the
warning he had received, that if he said one word about the
transaction, his life would pay for the indiscretion. At last he
fell off to sleep, to be awakened by a servant with the news,
that a certain great house in the Canongate had been burned
down, and the daughter of its owner perished in the flames.
The clergyman had been long dead, when a fire broke out on
the very same spot, and there, amid the flames, was seen a
beautiful woman, in an extraordinarily rich night-dress of the
fashion of half a century before. While the awe-struck spectators
gazed in wonder, the apparition cried, “Anes burned,
twice burned; the third time I’ll scare you all!” The midwife
of the Littlecote legend and the divine of the Edinburgh one
were more fortunate than the Irish doctor living at Rome in 1743;
this gentleman, according to Lady Hamilton, being taken blindfolded
to a house and compelled to open the veins of a young
lady who had loved not wisely, but too well.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BURIAL ALIVE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>In the year 1400, Ginevra de Amiera, a Florentine beauty,
married, under parental pressure, a man who had failed to win
her heart, that she had given to Antonio Rondinelli. Soon afterwards
the plague broke out in Florence; Ginevra fell ill, apparently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>succumbed to the malady, and being pronounced dead, was
the same day consigned to the family tomb. Some one, however,
had blundered in the matter, for in the middle of the night,
the entombed bride woke out of her trance, and badly as her
living relatives had behaved, found her dead ones still less to
her liking, and lost no time in quitting the silent company, upon
whose quietude she had unwittingly intruded. Speeding
through the sleep-wrapped streets as swiftly as her clinging
cerements allowed, Ginevra sought the home from which she had
so lately been borne. Roused from his slumbers by a knocking
at the door, the disconsolate widower of a day cautiously opened
an upper window, and seeing a shrouded figure waiting below, in
whose upturned face he recognized the lineaments of the dear
departed, he cried, “Go in peace, blessed spirit,” and shut the
window precipitately. With sinking heart and slackened step,
the repulsed wife made her way to her father’s door, to receive
the like benison from her dismayed parent. Then she crawled
on to an uncle’s, where the door was indeed opened, but only
to be slammed in her face by the frightened man, who, in his
hurry, forgot even to bless his ghostly caller. The cool night
air, penetrating the undress of the hapless wanderer, made her
tremble and shiver, as she thought she had waked to life only
to die again in the cruel streets. “Ah” she sighed, “Antonio
would not have proved so unkind.” This thought naturally
suggested it was her duty to test his love and courage: it would
be time enough to die if he proved like the rest. The way
was long, but hope renerved her limbs, and soon Ginevra was
knocking timidly at Rondinelli’s door. He opened it himself,
and although startled by the ghastly vision, calmly inquired what
the spirit wanted with him. Throwing her shroud away from
her face, Ginevra exclaimed, “I am no spirit, Antonio; I am
that Ginevra you once loved, who was buried yesterday—buried
alive!” and fell senseless into the welcoming arms of her astonished
lover, whose cries for help soon brought down his sympathizing
family to hear the wondrous story, and bear its heroine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_694'>694</span>to bed, to be tenderly tended until she bad recovered from the
shock, and was as beautiful as ever again. Then came the difficulty.
Was Ginevra to return to the man who had buried her,
and shut his doors against her, or give herself to the man who
had saved her from a second death? With such powerful special
pleaders as love and gratitude on his side, of course Rondinelli
won the day, and a private marriage made the lovers amends
for previous disappointment. They, however, had no intention
of keeping in hiding, but the very first Sunday after they became
man and wife, appeared in public together at the cathedral,
to the confusion and wonder of Ginevra’s friends. An explanation
ensued, which satisfied everybody except the lady’s first husband,
who insisted that nothing but her dying in genuine earnest
could dissolve the original matrimonial bond. The case was referred
to the bishop, who, having no precedent to curb his decision,
rose superior to technicalities, and declared that the first husband
had forfeited all right to Ginevra, and must pay over to Rondinelli
the dowry he had received with her: a decree at which
we may be sure all true lovers in fair Florence heartily rejoiced.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Italian romance of real life has its counterpart in a
French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cause célèbre</span></i>, but the Gallic version unfortunately lacks
names and dates; it differs, too, considerably in matters of detail;
instead of the lady being a supposed victim of the plague, which
in the older story secured her hasty interment, she was supposed
to have died of grief at being wedded against her inclination;
instead of coming to life of her own accord, and seeking her lover
as a last resource, the French heroine was taken out of her grave
by her lover, who suspected she was not really dead, and resuscitated
by his exertions, to flee with him to England. After living
happily together there for ten years, the strangely united couple
ventured to visit Paris, where the first husband accidentally
meeting the lady, was struck by her resemblance to his dead
wife, found out her abode, and finally claimed her for his own.
When the case came for trial, the second husband did not dispute
the fact of identity, but pleaded that his rival had renounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_695'>695</span>all claim to the lady by ordering her to be buried, without first
making sure she was dead, and that she would have been dead
and rotting in her grave if he had not rescued her. The court
was saved the trouble of deciding the knotty point, for, seeing
that it was likely to pronounce against them, the fond pair
quietly slipped out of France, and found refuge in “a foreign
clime, where their love continued sacred and entire, till death
conveyed them to those happy regions where love knows no end,
and is confined within no limits.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>RING STORIES.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Of dead-alive ladies brought to consciousness by sacrilegious
robbers, covetous of the rings upon their cold fingers, no less
than seven stories, differing but slightly from each other, have
been preserved; in one, the scene is laid in Halifax; in another,
in Gloucestershire; in a third, in Somersetshire; in the fourth,
in Drogheda; the remaining three being appropriated by as
many towns in Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ring-stories have a knack of running in one groove. Herodotus
tells us how Amasis advised Polycrates, as a charm against
misfortune, to throw away some gem he especially valued; how,
taking the advice, Polycrates went seaward in a boat, and
cast his favorite ring into the ocean; and how, a few days afterward,
a fisherman caught a large fish so extraordinarily fine,
that he thought it fit only for the royal table, and accordingly
presented it to the fortunate monarch, who ordered it to be
dressed for supper; and lo! when the fish was opened, the surprised
cook’s astonished eye beheld his master’s cast-away ring;
much to that master’s delight, but his adviser’s dismay; for
when Amasis heard of the wonderful event, he immediately dispatched
a herald to break his contract of friendship with Polycrates,
feeling confident the latter would come to an ill end,
“as he prospered in everything, even finding what he had thrown
away.” The city of Glasgow owes the ring-holding salmon
figuring in its armorial bearings to a legend concerning its patron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_696'>696</span>saint, Kentigern, thus told in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Sanctorum</span></cite>: A queen
who formed an improper attachment to a handsome soldier, put
upon his finger a precious ring which her own lord had conferred
upon her. The king, made aware of the fact, but dissembling
his anger, took an opportunity, in hunting, while the
soldier lay asleep beside the Clyde, to snatch off the ring, and
throw it into the river. Then returning home along with the
soldier, he demanded of the queen the ring he had given her.
She sent secretly to the soldier for the ring, which could not be
restored. In great terror, she then despatched a messenger to ask
the assistance of the holy Kentigern. He, who knew of the
affair before being informed of it, went to the river Clyde, and
having caught a salmon, took from the stomach the missing
ring, which he sent to the queen. She joyfully went with it to
the king, who, thinking he had wronged her, swore he would be
revenged upon her accusers; but she, affecting a forgiving temper,
besought him to pardon them as she had done. At the
same time, she confessed her error to Kentigern, and solemnly
vowed to be more careful of her conduct in future. In
1559, a merchant and alderman of Newcastle, named Anderson,
handling his ring as he leaned over the bridge, dropped it into
the Tyne. Some time after, his servant bought a salmon in the
market, in whose stomach the lost ring was found: its value
enhanced by the strange recovery, the ring became an heirloom
and was in the possession of one of the Alderman’s decendants
some forty years ago. A similar accident, ending in a similar way,
is recorded to have happened to one of the dukes of Lorraine.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>DEATH PROPHECIES.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Monk Gerbert, who wore the tiara as Sylvester II., a man
of whom it was said that—thanks to the devil’s assistance—he
never left anything unexecuted which he ever conceived, anticipating
Roger Bacon, made a brazen head capable of answering
like an oracle. From this creature of his own, Gerbert learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>he would not die until he had performed mass in Jerusalem.
He thereupon determined to live forever by taking good care
never to go near the holy city. Like all dealers with the Evil
One, he was destined to be cheated. Performing mass one day
in Rome, Sylvester was seized with sudden illness, and upon
inquiring the name of the church in which he had officiated,
heard, to his dismay, that it was popularly called Jerusalem;
then he knew his end was at hand; and it was not long before
it came. Nearly five hundred years after this event happened,
Master Robert Fabian, who must not be suspected of inventing
history, seeing, as sheriff and alderman, he was wont to pillory
public liars, wrote of Henry IV., “After the feast of Christmas,
while he was making his prayers at St. Edward’s shrine,
he became so sick, that such as were about him feared that he
would have died right there; wherefore they, for his comfort,
bare him into the abbot’s place, and lodged him in a chamber;
and there, upon a pallet, laid him before the fire, where he lay
in great agony a certain time. At length, when he was come
to himself, not knowing where he was, he freyned [asked] of
such as were there about him what place that was; the which
shewed to him that it belonged unto the Abbot of Westminster;
and for he felt himself so sick, he commanded to ask if
that chamber had any special name. Whereunto it was answered,
that it was named Jerusalem. Then said the king, ‘Laud
be to the Father of Heaven, for now I know I shall die in this
chamber, according to the prophecy of me beforesaid, that I
should die in Jerusalem;’ and so after, he made himself ready,
and died shortly after, upon the Day of St. Cuthbert, on the
20th day of March, 1413.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BATTLES.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Three of the most famous battles recorded in English history
were marked by a strange contrast between the behavior of the
opposing armies on the eve of the fight. At Hastings, the
Saxons spent the night in singing, feasting, and drinking; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>the Normans were confessing themselves and receiving the sacrament.
At Agincourt, “the poor condemned English” said
their prayers, and sat patiently by their watch-fires, to “inly
ruminate the morrow’s danger;” while the over-confident French
revelled the night through, and played for the prisoners they
were never to take. “On the eve of Bannockburn,” says Paston,
who fought there on the beaten side, “ye might have seen the
Englishmen bathing themselves in wine, and casting their gorgets;
there was crying, shouting, wassailing, and drinking, with
other rioting far above measure. On the other side we might
have seen the Scots, quiet, still, and close, fasting the eve of
St. John the Baptist, laboring in love of the liberties of their
country.” Our readers need not be told that in each case the
orderly, prayerful army proved victorious, and so made the
treble parallel perfect.</p>

<h4 class='c016'>BISHOP HATTO.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The legend of Hatto, bishop of Mayence, has been preserved
in stanzas which are well remembered by school children. To
avoid the importunity of the starving during a period of famine,
the wicked prelate collected them into a barn,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And while for mercy on Christ they call,</div>
      <div class='line'>He set fire to the barn, and burnt them all.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thereupon he was attacked by an army of mice, and escaped
to his tower (the Mäuseschloss) on a rock in the Rhine. But
they quickly followed him and poured in by thousands, “in at
the windows and in at the door,” until he was overpowered and
destroyed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They gnawed the flesh from every limb,</div>
      <div class='line'>For they were sent to do judgment on him.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The same story is told of the Swiss baron, von Güttingen,
who was pursued and devoured by mice in his castle in Lake
Constance. It is also told, with a variation, of the Polish King
Popiel. When the Poles murmured at his bad government,
and sought redress, he summoned the chief remonstrants to his
palace, poisoned them, and had their bodies thrown into the
lake Gopolo. He sought refuge from the mice within a circle
of fire, but was overrun and eaten by them.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE OLDEST PROVERB.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It appears from I Samuel xxiv. 13, that the oldest proverb
on record, is, “Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked;” since
David, in his time, declared it to be “a proverb of the ancients;”
consequently older than any proverb of his son Solomon.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHAKSPEARE SAID IT FIRST.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In one of Clough’s letters he tells an amusing story of a
Calvinistic old lady, who, on being asked about the Universalists,
observed,—“Yes, they expect that everybody will be saved,
but we look for better things.” How like this is to the
admirable confusion of Sir Andrew Aguecheek, who, in his
letter of challenge, (<cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, iii. 4,) concludes thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls!</div>

<h3 class='c012'>CINDERELLA’S SLIPPER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A story somewhat similar to that of Cinderella has been
handed down from the Greek. It is reported of Rhodopis,—a
Thracian slave, who was purchased and manumitted by Charaxus
of Mytilene, and afterward settled in Egypt,—that one
day, while she was in the bath, an eagle, having flown down,
snatched one of her slippers from an attendant, and carried it
to Memphis. Psammitichus, the king, at the time, was sitting
on his tribunal, and while engaged in dispensing justice, the
eagle, settling above his head, dropped the sandal into his
bosom. Astonished by the singularity of the event, and struck
by the diminutive size and elegant shape of the sandal, the king
ordered search to be made for the owner throughout the land
of Egypt. Having found her at Naucratis, she was presented
to the king, who made her his queen.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>CURTAIN LECTURES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Jerrold, in his preface to the later editions of <cite>Mrs. Caudle’s
Curtain Lectures</cite>, makes this curious statement:—</p>

<p class='c018'>It has happened to the writer that two, or three, or ten, or twenty
gentlewomen have asked him ... <i>What could have made you think of
Mrs. Caudle? How could such a thing have entered any man’s mind?</i>
There are subjects that seem like rain-drops to fall upon a man’s head, the
head itself having nothing to do with the matter.... And this was, no doubt,
the accidental cause of the literary sowing and expansion—unfolding like
a night-flower—of <span class='sc'>Mrs. Caudle</span>.... The writer, still dreaming and musing,
and still following no distinct line of thought, there struck upon him, like
notes of sudden household music, these words—<span class='sc'>Curtain Lectures</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, this phrase may be traced back more than two
centuries, while the idea will be found in the Sixth Satire of
Juvenal, who says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Semper habet lites, alternaque jurgia lectus,</div>
      <div class='line'>In quo nupta jacet: minimum dormitur in illo, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Stapylton’s translation of this passage was published in
1647:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Debates, alternate brawlings, ever were</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ th’ marriage bed: there is no sleeping there.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the margin of the translation are the words <i>Curtain-Lectures</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dryden in his translation of the same passage (published
1693) introduces the phrase into the text:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Besides, what endless brawls by wives are bred;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Curtain-Lecture makes a mournful bed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Addison, in the <cite>Tatler</cite>, describing a luckless wight
undergoing the penalty of a nocturnal oration, says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>I could not but admire his exemplary patience, and discovered, by his
whole behavior, that he was then lying under the discipline of a <i>curtain
lecture</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The metre, movement, and idea of Tennyson’s Charge of the
Six Hundred at Balaklava, are evidently derived from Michael
Drayton’s <cite>Battle of Agincourt</cite>, published in 1627. The first,
middle and last stanzas of Drayton’s poem run thus:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FAUST LEGENDS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>About the middle of the thirteenth century began to spread
the notion of formal written agreements between the Fiend and
men who were to be his exclusive property after a certain time,
during which he was to help them to all earthly good. This,
curious to say, came with Christianity from the East. The first
instance was that of Theophilus, vicedominus of the Bishop of
Adana, a city of Cilicia, in the sixth century, whose fall and
conversion form the original of all the Faust legends. The story
of Theophilus may be found in various works, among them
Ennemoser’s <cite>Universal History of Magic</cite>, which was translated
by William Howitt.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>AIR CUSHIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Ben Jonson, in the <cite>Alchemist</cite>, makes Sir Epicure Mammon,
in his expectation of acquiring the secret of the philosopher’s
stone, enumerate to Surly a list of anticipated luxuries. Among
these indulgences is this prophetic forecast of modern inflated
India-rubber beds and cushions:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I will have all my beds <i>blown up</i>, not <i>stuffed</i>;</div>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CAT IN THE ADAGE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Lady Macbeth thus taunts her husband:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>Wouldst thou have that</div>

      <div class='line'>Like the poor cat i’ the adage?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The adage is thus given in Heywood’s <cite>Proverbs</cite>, 1566:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The cat would eate fishe, and would not wet her feete.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The proverb is found among all nations. The Latin form of
mediæval times was as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catus amat pisces, sed non vult tingere plantas.</span>”</div>

<p class='c018'>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Katze hätt’ die Fische gern; aber sie will die Füsse nit nass

<h3 class='c012'>CORK LEGS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A gentleman in Charleston conceived a very decided liking
to a young lady from Ireland, and was on the eve of popping
the question, when he was told by a friend that his dulcinea
had a cork leg. It is difficult to imagine the distress of the
young Carolinian. He went to her father’s house, knocked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>impatiently at the door, and when admitted to the fair one’s
presence, asked her if what he had heard respecting her were
true. “Yes, indeed, my dear Sir, it is true enough, but you
have heard only half of my misfortune. I have got two cork
legs, having had the ill-luck to be born in Cork.” This is
the incident on which is founded Hart’s afterpiece called
<cite>Perfection</cite>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE POPE’S BULL AGAINST THE COMET.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When President Lincoln was first asked to issue a proclamation
abolishing slavery in the Southern States, he replied that
such an act would be as absurd as the Pope’s bull against the
comet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The comet referred to is Halley’s. Concerning its first
authenticated appearance, Admiral Smyth, in his <cite>Cycle of
Celestial Objects</cite>, says:—</p>

<p class='c018'>In 1456 it came with a tail 60° in length, and of a vivid brightness;
which splendid train affrighted all Europe, and spread consternation in
every quarter. To its malign influences were imputed the rapid successes
of Mahomet II., which then threatened all Christendom. The general
alarm was greatly aggravated by the conduct of Pope Calixtus III., who,
though otherwise a man of abilities, was but a poor astronomer; for that
pontiff daily ordered the church bells to be rung at noontide, extra Ave
Marias to be repeated, and a special protest and excommunication was
composed, exorcising equally the devil, the Turks, and the comet.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SWAPPING HORSES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The celebrated maxim of President Lincoln, “not to swap
horses while fording the stream,” was anticipated centuries ago
by Cyrus the Elder, King of Persia, in directing his troops to
take up their several stations, when he said, “When the contest
is about to begin, there is no longer time for any chariot to
unyoke the horses for a change.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WOODEN NUTMEGS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Judge Haliburton, in that amusing book <cite>The Clockmaker</cite>,
puts the following in the mouth of Sam Slick:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>That remark seemed to grig him a little; he felt oneasy like, and walked
twice across the room, fifty fathoms deep in thought; at last he said,
“Which way are you from, Mr. Slick, this hitch?” “Why,” says I, “I’ve
been away up South a speculating in nutmegs.” “I hope,” says the Professor,
“they were a good article,—the real right down genuine thing?”
“No, mistake,” says I, “no mistake, Professor; they were all prime, first
chop; but why did you ax that ’ere question?” “Why,” says he, “that
eternal scoundrel, that Captain John Allspice of Nahant, he used to trade
to Charleston, and he carried a cargo once there of fifty barrels of nutmegs.
Well, he put half a bushel of good ones into each end of the
barrel, and the rest he filled up with wooden ones, so like the real thing,
no soul could tell the difference until <i>he bit one with his teeth</i>, and that he
never thought of doing until he was first <i>bit himself</i>. Well, it’s been a
standing joke with them Southerners agin us ever since.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TRADE UNIONS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Trade unions are not of such recent origin as many people
suppose. “I am credibly informed,” wrote Mandeville, the
philosophic author of the <cite>Fables of the Bees</cite>, one hundred and
fifty years ago, in his <cite>Essay on Charity and Charity Schools</cite>,
“that a parcel of footmen are arrived to that height of insolence
as to have entered into a society together, and made laws
by which they oblige themselves not to serve for less than such
a sum, nor carry burdens, or any bundle or parcel above a
certain weight not exceeding two or three pounds, with other
regulations directly opposite to the interest of those they serve,
and altogether destructive to the use they were designed for.
If any of them be turned away for strictly adhering to the orders
of this honorable corporation, he is taken care of till another
service is provided for him; but there is no money wanting at
any time to commence and maintain a lawsuit against any
that shall pretend to strike or offer any other injury to his
gentleman footman, contrary to the statutes of their society.
If this be true, as I believe it is, and they are suffered to go
on in consulting and providing for their own ease and conveniency
any further, we may expect quickly to see the French
comedy ‘Le Maitre le Valet’ acted in good earnest in most
families; while, if not redressed in a little time, and these footmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>increase their company to the number it is possible they
may, as well as assemble when they please with impunity, it
will be in their power to make a tragedy of it whenever they
have a mind to.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>On page 454 of Senator Wilson’s <cite>Rise and Fall of the
Slave Power in America</cite>, he says (of a speech of the late Mr.
Giddings): “He referred to the Treaty of Indian Springs, by
which, after paying the slaveholders of Georgia the sum of
$109,000 for slaves who had escaped to Florida, it added the
sum of $141,000 as compensation demanded for the offspring
which the females would have borne to their masters had they
remained in bondage; and Congress actually paid that sum for
children who were never born, but who might have been if
their parents had remained faithful slaves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no clearer case of the payment of “consequential
damages” in English or American history than this.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE ORIGINAL SHYLOCK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Gregory Leti, in his biography of Sextus V., tells us that
Paul Secchi, a Venetian merchant, having learned by private
advices that Admiral Francis Blake had conquered St. Domingo,
communicated the news to a Jewish merchant named Sampson
Ceneda. The latter was so confident that the information was
false, that, after repeated protestations, he said, “I bet a pound
of my flesh that the report is untrue.” “And I lay a thousand
scudi against it,” rejoined the Christian, who caused a bond to
be drawn to the effect that in case the report should prove
untrue, then the Christian merchant, Signor Paul Secchi, is
bound to pay the Jewish merchant the sum of 1000 scudi, and
on the other hand, if the truth of the news be confirmed, the
Christian merchant, Signor Paul Secchi, is justified and empowered
to cut with his own hand, with a well-sharpened knife,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>a pound of the Jew’s fair flesh, of that part of the body it
might please him. When the news proved true, the Christian
insisted on his bond, but the governor, having got wind of the
affair, reported it to the Pope, who condemned both Jew and
Christian to the galleys, from which they could only be ransomed
by paying a fine of double the amount of the wager.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakspeare reverses the order, and makes the Jew usurer
demand the pound of flesh from the Christian merchant.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EXCOMMUNICATION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The excommunication of the Roman Catholic Church, exactly
described by anticipation in Cæsar’s account of their predecessors,
the Heathen Druids, will be found in Cæsar, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Bello
Gallico</span></cite>, Book VI. Chap, iii., the passage beginning “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si quis
aut privatus aut publicus</span>,” and ending “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neque honos ullus
communicatur</span>.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They decree rewards and punishments, and if any one refuses to submit
to their sentence, whether magistrate or private man, they interdict him
the sacrifices. This is the greatest punishment that can be inflicted among
the Gauls; because such as are under this prohibition are considered as
impious and wicked; all men shun them, and decline their conversation
and fellowship, lest they should suffer from the contagion of their misfortunes.
They can neither have recourse to the law for justice, nor are
capable of any public office.</p>

<p class='c000'>This inscription, the highest compliment ever paid to the
American philosopher and statesman, and originally ascribed to
Condorcet and Mirabeau, was written by Turgot, Louis XVI.’s
minister and controller-general of finance, and first appeared
in the correspondence of Grimm and Diderot, April, 1778. It
is, however, merely a modification of a line in the <cite>Anti-Lucretius

<p class='c000'>Taking the laurel from the brow of Epicurus to place it upon

<h3 class='c012'>THE MECKLENBURG DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among those who sympathized most deeply with the oppressed
inhabitants of New England, and who were earliest to
express indignation at the outrages of British tyranny, were
the militia-officers of North Carolina, most of whom were Presbyterians
of Scotch-Irish nativity. On the 20th of May, 1775,
the delegates of the Mecklenburg convention, “after sitting in
the court-house all night, neither sleepy, hungry, nor fatigued,
and after discussing every paragraph,” unanimously passed the
following resolutions. It will be observed that this memorable
Declaration of Independence contains many of the ideas, and
some of the very phrases and forms of expression, afterwards
employed by Mr. Jefferson, and incorporated in his draft of
that great national document whose adoption, on the 4th of
July, 1776, gave birth to a nation of freemen. The more
striking similarities are here shown in Italics:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span>, That whosoever directly or indirectly abetted, or
in any way, form, or manner countenanced, the unchartered
and dangerous invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain,
is an enemy to this country, to America, and to the <i>inherent
and inalienable rights</i><a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> of Man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span>, That we, the citizens of Mecklenburg county, do
hereby <i>dissolve the political bands which have connected</i> us to
the mother country, and hereby <i>absolve ourselves from all allegiance
to the British Crown, and abjure all political connection</i>,
contract, or association with that Nation, who have wantonly
trampled on our rights and liberties, and inhumanly shed the
blood of American patriots at Lexington.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span><span class='sc'>Resolved</span>, That we do hereby <i>declare ourselves a free and
independent people; are, and of right ought to be, a sovereign
and self-governing association</i>, under the control of no power
other than that of <span class='sc'>our God</span>, and the general Government of
the Congress; <i>to the maintenance of which independence we
solemnly pledge to each other our mutual co-operation, our lives,
our fortunes, and our most sacred honor</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span>, That as we now acknowledge the existence and
control of no law or legal officer, civil or military, within this
country, we do hereby ordain and adopt as a rule of life all,
each, and every of our former laws; wherein, nevertheless, the
Crown of Great Britain never can be considered as holding
rights, privileges, immunities, or authorities therein.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Resolved</span>, That it is further decreed that all, each, and
every military officer in this county is hereby reinstated in his
former command and authority, he acting conformably to these
regulations; and that every member present of this delegation
shall henceforth be a civil officer, viz.: a Justice of the Peace
in the character of a “Committee-man,” to issue process, hear
and determine all matters of controversy, according to said
adopted laws, and to preserve peace, union, and harmony in said
county; and to use every exertion to spread the love of country
and fire of freedom throughout America, until a more general
and organized government be established in the Province.</p>

<p class='c000'>After discussing the foregoing resolves, and arranging by-laws
and regulations for the government of a Standing Committee
of Public Safety, who were selected from their delegates,
the whole proceedings were unanimously adopted and
signed. A select committee was then appointed to draw up a
more full and definite statement of grievances, and a more
formal Declaration of Independence. The delegation then adjourned
about two o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span></p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE KNOW-NOTHINGS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The recent political organization under this odd title, which
presented one of the most singular features that has yet diversified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>American history, has its archetype in the Church whose
progress in this country it was designed to oppose. In Italy
there was formerly a strange order of monks calling themselves
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fratres Ignorantiæ</span></i>, “Brothers of Ignorance.” They used to
bind themselves by oath not to understand nor to learn any
thing, and answered all questions by saying, <i>Nescio</i>, “I do not
know.” Their first proposition was, “Though you do not understand
the words you speak, yet the Holy Ghost understands
them, and the devil flees.” In opposing mental acquirements,
they argued thus:—“Suppose this friar studies and becomes a
learned man, the consequence will be that he will want to become
our superior: therefore, put the sack around his neck,
and let him go begging from house to house, in town and
country.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE ORIGINAL OF BUNYAN’S PILGRIM’S PROGRESS.</h3>

<p class='c013'><cite>The Isle of Man, or the Legal Proceedings in Manshire
against Sin, wherein, by way of a continual Allegory, the chief
malefactors disturbing both Church and Commonwealth are
detected and attached, with their arraignment and judicial
trial, according to the laws of England; the spiritual use
thereof, with an apology for the manner of handling most
necessary to be first read, for direction in the right use of the
allegory. By the Rev. Richard Bernard.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>An allegory with the above title, originally published more
than two hundred years ago, was reprinted in Bristol, England,
in 1803. In a note to this edition, addressed to the reader,
the editor states that the work is prized as well on account of
the ingenuity of the performance as the probability of its
having suggested to Mr. John Bunyan the first idea of his Pilgrim’s
Progress, and of his Holy War, which was intimated on
a leaf facing the title-page, by the late Rev. Mr. Toplady.</p>

<p class='c000'>The editor says, “That Bunyan had seen the book may be
inferred from its extensive circulation, for in one year only
after its first publication it ran through seven editions.” He
then proceeds to the internal evidence, and points out a supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>similarity between the characters in the two works, as
between Wilful Will of the one and Will-be-Will of the other;
Mr. Worldly Wiseman of Bunyan and Sir Worldly Wise of
Bernard; Soul’s Town of Bernard and Bunyan’s Town of
Man’s Soul, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the book has no very high order of genius to commend
it is evident from the fact that it has passed into comparative
obscurity. The world does not suffer the works of true prophets
to die. Still, there is enough in it to render it worthy of
being held in remembrance; and, antedating Bunyan as it does,
passing through seven editions immediately after its first publication,
presenting some striking analogies with the great master
of allegory, and sinking into obscurity before the brighter and
more enduring light of the Bedford tinker, its author deserves
honorable mention for his attempt to present religious truth in
a striking and impressive form at a period when such attempts
were rare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Southey, in his <cite>Commonplace Book</cite>, gives a long quotation
from <cite>Lucian’s Hermotimus</cite>, to show how Bunyan was anticipated,
in the main idea of his allegory, by a Greek writer, as
far back as the second century.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another claimant for this Telemachus of Protestant religious
literature has recently been brought to light by Catherine
Isabella Curt, who has just published in London a translation
of an old French manuscript in the British Museum, which is
almost word for word the Pilgrim’s Progress. The manuscript
is the work of a clergyman, G de Grideville, who lived in the
fifteenth century. Its title, in Norman English, is <cite>Pylgremage
of the Sowle</cite>. The printer, Caxton, who occupied the
same position in London as the Etiennes of Paris, published in
1483 a translation of this manuscript, of which the authenticity
appears incontestable. It would seem, therefore, that
the credit of this celebrated book belongs to France, although
France hitherto has shown less appreciation of the original than
England has bestowed on the copy.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>ROBINSON CRUSOE: WHO WROTE IT?</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Disraeli, in his ever-charming <cite>Curiosities of Literature</cite>, expresses
boldly the opinion that “no one had, or perhaps could
have, converted the history of Selkirk into the wonderful story
we possess but De Foe himself.” So have we all been accustomed
to believe, from those careless, happy days of boyhood
when we pored intently over the entrancing pages of “Robinson
Crusoe” and wished that we also could have a desert
island, a summer bower, and a winter-cave retreat, as well as he.
But there is, alas! some slight ground at least for believing
that De Foe <i>did not write</i> that immortal tale, or, at all events,
the better portion of it, viz., the first part or volume of the
work. In Sir H. Ellis’s <cite>Letters of Eminent Literary Men</cite>
(Camden Soc. Pub. 1843, vol. 23), p. 420, Letter 137 is from
“Daniel De Foe to the Earl of Halifax, engaging himself to
his lordship as a political writer.” In a note by the editor a
curious anecdote is given, quoted from “a volume of Memoranda
in the handwriting of Thomas Warton, poet-laureate,
preserved in the British Museum,” in relation to the actual
authorship of the “Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe.”
The extract is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mem. July 10, 1774.—In the year 1759, I was told by the
Rev. Mr. Hollaway, rector of Middleton Stoney, in Oxfordshire,
then about seventy years old, and in the early part of his
life chaplain to Lord Sunderland, that he had often heard Lord
Sunderland say that Lord Oxford, while prisoner in the Tower
of London, wrote the first volume of the History of Robinson
Crusoe, merely as an amusement under confinement, and gave
it to Daniel De Foe, who frequently visited Lord Oxford in
the Tower and was one of his pamphlet-writers; that De Foe,
by Lord Oxford’s permission, printed it as his own, and, encouraged
by its extraordinary success, added himself the second
volume, the inferiority of which is generally acknowledged.
Mr. Holloway also told me, from Lord Sunderland, that Lord
Oxford dictated some parts of the manuscript to De Foe. Mr
Hollaway,”—Warton adds,—“was a grave, conscientious clergyman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>not vain of telling anecdotes, very learned, particularly a
good Orientalist, author of some theological tracts, bred at Eton
School, and a Master of Arts of St. John’s College, Cambridge.
He used to say that ‘Robinson Crusoe at its first publication,
and for some time afterward, was universally received and
credited as a genuine history. A fictitious narrative of this
sort was then a new thing.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides, it may be added, the <i>real</i> and somewhat similar circumstances
of Alexander Selkirk’s solitary abode of four years
and four months on the island of Juan Fernandez, had, only a
few years previously, been the subject of general conversation,
and had therefore prepared the public mind for the possibility,
if not the probability, of such adventures.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PROVERB MISASCRIBED TO DEFOE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In an article on the writings of Daniel Defoe, in a late
number of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, the critic refers to the <i>True-Born
Englishman</i>, the opening quatrain of which is quoted as
being “all that will ever be remembered of the poem.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wherever God erects a house of prayer,</div>
      <div class='line'>The devil is sure to build a chapel there;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’twill be found, upon examination,</div>
      <div class='line'>The latter has the largest congregation.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A recent number of Chambers’s <cite>Papers for the People</cite> also
contains an article on Defoe, in which the same lines are quoted
as having since grown into a proverb. It is evident that the
two critics believed the idea to be original with Defoe. But
they were both in error; for in an old tract, entitled <cite>The Vineyarde
of Vertue</cite>, printed in 1591, seventy-seven years before
Defoe was born, may be found the following sentence:—</p>

<p class='c018'>It is oftentimes seene, that as God hath his Churche, so will the Deuill
have a Chappell.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was also used before Defoe’s time by George Herbert and
Robert Burton. The former says, in his <cite>Jacula Prudentum</cite>,
“No sooner is a temple built to God, but the Devil builds a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_714'>714</span>chapel hard by;” and the latter, in his <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>,
thus expresses it: “Where God hath a Temple the Devil will
have a Chapel.” It is evident that Defoe only versified a well-known
proverb of his day.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE USE OF LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>To Talleyrand has generally been attributed the authorship
of the maxim that “the use of language is to conceal our
thoughts.” (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La parole a été donnée à l’homme pour aider à
cacher sa pensée.</span>)</p>

<p class='c000'>In Pycroft’s <cite>Ways and Words of Men of Letters</cite>, a quotation
is made from an article on <cite>The Use of Language</cite>, published in
a periodical called the <cite>Bee</cite>, under date of October 20, 1759,
which reads as follows: “He who best knows how to conceal
his necessity and desires is the most likely person to find
redress; and <i>the true use of speech is not so much to express
our wants as to conceal them</i>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly a century before this, Dr. South preached a sermon
in Westminster Abbey, on <cite>The Wisdom of the World</cite>, in which
he said, “Men speak with designs of mischief, and therefore
they speak in the dark. In short, this seems to be the true
inward judgment of all our politic sages, that speech was
given to the ordinary sort of men whereby to communicate
their mind, <i>but to wise men whereby to conceal it</i>.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SCANDINAVIAN SKULL CUPS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>What a pretty tale was slaughtered when Grenville Piggot
pointed out, in his <cite>Manual of Scandinavian Mythology</cite>, the
blundering translation of the passage in an old Scandinavian
poem relating to the occupation of the blest in the halls of
Valhalla, the Northern paradise! “Soon shall we drink out of
the curved horns of the head,” are the words in the death-song
of Regner Lodbrog; meaning by this violent figure to
say that they would imbibe their liquor out of cups formed
from the crooked horns of animals. The first translators,
however, not seeing their way clearly, rendered the passage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_715'>715</span>“Soon shall we drink out of the <i>skulls of our enemies</i>;” and
to this strange banqueting there are allusions without end to
be met with in our literature. Peter Pindar, for example, once
said that the booksellers, like the heroes of Valhalla, drank
their wine out of the skulls of authors.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GREAT LITERARY PLAGIARISM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The <cite>London Athenæum</cite> asserts that Paley’s Natural Theology
is copied from a series of papers which appeared about the
end of the seventeenth century, in the <cite>Leipsic Transactions</cite>,
written by a Dutch philosopher named Nieuwentyt. It is extraordinary
that this discovery was not made before, inasmuch
as the papers, after having been published at Amsterdam about
the year 1700, were afterwards translated into English by Mr.
Chamberlayne, and published by Longman &amp; Co., in 1818,
about fifteen years after Paley’s Natural Theology appeared.
As Paley quotes Dr. Nieuwentyt from the <cite>Leipsic Transactions</cite>,
he, of course, must have known and perused them. Parallel
passages are printed side by side in the <cite>Athenæum</cite>, for the
purpose of proving the assertion.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE WANDERING JEW.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The success of <cite>Le Juif Errant</cite> of M. Sue, when first published,
arose doubtless from two causes: the deep hold upon the
popular heart which the legend of the lonely wanderer naturally
acquired, and the reaction against papacy at that period.
The efforts of the church, and particularly of the Society of
Jesus, against which it was specially directed, to either suppress
it or neutralize its effects, tended the more to extend its influence.
The legend of a wanderer, pursued by some fate or power
above, suffering, solitary and deathless, is as old as the human
race. It takes a new form with every step in human progress,
adapting itself to the character of the period and place where it
reappears. It belongs to the early East, notably the Hindoo
legendary literature, to Greece and Rome, and to Christendom,
taking shape rather from the religious than the ethical elements
of character. The Wandering Jew of Christendom varies with
times and places, as his name also varies. He is Salathiel,
Ahasuerus, Cartaphilus, Theudas, Zerib Bar Elia, Isbal, Michob-Ader,
Bultadœus, Isaac Laquedon or something else, as circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span>determine. The German designation—the Everlasting
Jew, <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">der ewige Jude</span></i>—is more specifically significant really than
that of other languages, in most of which it is “wandering.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The weird figure, wandering in fulfillment of his doom in the
Carpathians, or halting at Nürnberg or Bamberg, or going in
and out among the peasantry of Brittany or Wales, is an
attractive subject: a vague, shadowy form; mortal and yet immortal;
typical at once of man’s liability to death, and of his
everlasting existence. He has the passions and anxieties and
sorrows of manhood, and is endowed with a function which
places him beyond the operations of Providence. From the
earliest notice of this hero, which occurs in the Chronicles of
the Abbey of St. Albans, he appears in numerous and manifold
literary forms—drama, lyric, ballad, historical poem, legend,
novel, study, essay, chronicle, biography, myth and paragraph,
to the extent of perhaps a hundred volumes. The legends of
most of these agree in representing the Jew as a wanderer since
the day of the crucifixion, sometimes repentant and sometimes
defiant, but always going. From this general voice Dr. Croly,
in his <cite>Salathiel</cite>, upon a true artistic principle, departs, and makes
his doomed one live only the usual period of man’s life. His
Jew is repentant and anxious to die, and dies in due season. The
Jew of M. Eubule-Evans, in the <cite>Curse of Immortality</cite>, also is
repentant, but, pursued by implacable vengeance of the
Almighty, he refuses, in his morbid pride, to purchase the repose
of death at the price of self-abasement; but at last reaches contrition
through the softening influence of human love, repents
and dies.</p>

<p class='c000'>With similar general characteristics the wanderer of M. Sue’s
powerful melodramatic story seeks death in every clime and
form: but lives on, wanders on, and toils to achieve human ends,
until the close of the romance, when the hero sets out anew.
Our readers are doubtless familiar with the story—the scattered
heirs of a fortune of two million francs to be divided among
them upon condition of their assembling at a given hour in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span>given room in Paris; and the machinations of the wily Jesuit
Rodin, whose end was to secure the money for his own society.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chronicles of the Abbey of St. Albans, already referred
to, report the following circumstantial details:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1228, a certain archbishop of Armenia came on
a pilgrimage to England to see the relics of the saints, and visit
the sacred places in this kingdom, as he had done in others; he
also produced letters of recommendation from his Holiness the
Pope to the religious men and prelates of the churches, in
which they were enjoined to receive and entertain him with due
reverence and honor. On his arrival, he came to St. Albans,
where he was received with all respect by the abbot and monks;
and at this place, being fatigued with his journey, he remained
some days to rest himself and his followers. In the course of
conversation by means of their interpreters, he made many
inquiries relating to the religion and religious observances of
this country, and told many strange things concerning the
countries of the East. In the course of conversation he was
asked whether he had ever seen or heard anything of Joseph,
a man of whom there was much talk in the world, who, when
our Lord suffered, was present and spoke to him, and who is still
alive, in evidence to the Christian faith; in reply to which a
knight in his retinue, who was his interpreter, replied, speaking
in French, “My Lord well knows that man, and a little before
he took his way to the western countries, the said Joseph ate at
the table of my lord the archbishop in Armenia, and he has
often seen and held converse with him.” He was then asked
about what had passed between Christ and the said Joseph, to
which he replied, “At the time of the suffering of Jesus Christ,
he was seized by the Jews and led into the hall of judgment,
before Pilate, the governor, that he might be judged by him on
the accusation of the Jews; and Pilate finding no cause for
adjudging him to death, said to them, ‘Take him and judge
him according to your law;’ the shouts of the Jews, however,
increasing, he, at their request, released unto them Barabbas, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>delivered Jesus to them to be crucified. When, therefore, the
Jews were dragging Jesus forth, and had reached the door,
Cartaphilus, a porter of the hall, in Pilate’s service, as Jesus
was going out of the door, impiously struck him on the back
with his hand, and said in mockery, ‘Go quicker, Jesus, go
quicker; why do you loiter?’ and Jesus looking back on him
with a severe countenance, said to him, ‘I am going and you will
wait till I return.’ And according as our Lord said, this Cartaphilus
is still awaiting his return. At the time of our Lord’s
suffering he was thirty years old, and when he attains the age
of a hundred years, he always returns to the same age as he
was when our Lord suffered. After Christ’s death, when the
Catholic faith gained ground, this Cartaphilus was baptized
by Ananias (who also baptized the apostle Paul), and was called
Joseph. He dwells in one or other division of Armenia, and in
divers Eastern countries, passing his time amongst the bishops
and other prelates of the church; he is a man of holy conversation,
and religious; a man of few words, and circumspect in
his behavior, for he does not speak at all unless when questioned
by the bishops and religious men, and then he tells of the events
of old times, and of those which occurred at the suffering and
resurrection of our Lord, and of the witnesses of the resurrection,
namely, those who rose with Christ, and went into the holy city,
and appeared unto men. He also tells of the creed of the
apostles, and of their separation and preaching. And all this he
relates without smiling or levity of conversation, as one who is
well practised in sorrow and the fear of God; always looking
forward with fear to the coming of Jesus Christ, lest at the last
judgment he should find him in anger, whom, when on his way
to death, he had provoked to just vengeance. Numbers come to
him from different parts of the world, enjoying his society and
conversation; and to them, if they are men of authority, he
explains all doubts on the matters on which he is questioned.
He refuses all gifts that are offered to him, being content with
slight food and clothing.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_720'>720</span>Of the myths of the Middle Ages, none is more striking
than that of the Wandering Jew; indeed it is so well calculated
to arrest the attention and to excite the imagination, that it is
remarkable that we should find an interval of three centuries
between its first introduction into Europe by Matthew Paris

century. Of the romances of Eugéne Sue and Dr. Croly, founded

the poetical attempts upon the story fared better. It was
reserved for the pencil of Gustave Doré to treat it with the
originality it merited, and in a series of wood-cuts to produce
at once a poem, a romance, and a chef-d’œuvre of art.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE MOST CURIOUS BOOK IN THE WORLD.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The most singular bibliographic curiosity is that which belonged
to the family of the Prince de Ligne, and is now in
France. It is entitled <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Passionis Domini Nostri Jesu
Christi, cum Characteribus Nulla Materia Compositis</span></cite>. This
book is neither written nor printed! The whole letters of the
text are cut out of each folio upon the finest vellum; and, being
interleaved with blue paper, it is read as easily as the best print.
The labor and patience bestowed in its completion must have
been excessive, especially when the precision and minuteness
of the letters are considered. The general execution, in every
respect, is indeed admirable; and the vellum is of the most
delicate and costly kind. Rodolphus II. of Germany offered
for it, in 1640, eleven thousand ducats, which was probably
equal to sixty thousand at this day. The most remarkable circumstance
connected with this literary treasure is, that it bears
the royal arms of England, but it cannot be traced to have
ever been in that country.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SILVER BOOK.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the Library of Upsal, in Sweden, there is preserved a
translation of the Four Gospels, printed with metal types upon
violet-colored vellum. The letters are silver, and hence it has
received the name of <cite>Codex Argenteus</cite>. The initial letters are
in gold. It is supposed that the whole was printed in the same
manner as bookbinders letter the titles of books on the back.
It was a very near approach to the discovery of the art of
printing; but it is not known how old it is.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE LETTERS OF JUNIUS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Junius” was the name or signature of a writer who published,
at intervals between 1769 and 1772, a series of political
papers on the leading questions and men of that day. They
appeared in the newspaper called the <cite>Public Advertiser</cite>, and
attracted immense attention, partly from the high position of
the characters assailed, (among whom was George III. himself,)
and still more from their brilliancy of style, their boldness of
tone, and the tremendous severity of the invectives employed in
them. The letters are still models of that species of writing,—though
it has since risen to such a point of excellence generally
as would greatly weaken the force of any similar phenomena
if appearing in our day. However, from the monarch
to the meanest of his subjects, all men were impressed deeply
at the time by the letters of Junius, the mystery attending
their authorship adding largely to their influence. It was a
mystery at the moment, and remains a puzzle still. Not even
the publisher, Woodfall, knew who his correspondent was, or,
at least, not certainly. Yet all the world felt the letters to be
the work of no common man. Their most remarkable feature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_724'>724</span>indeed, was the intimate familiarity with high people and official
life which they so clearly evinced. “A traitor in the
camp!” was the cry of the leading statesmen of the period.
Hence it occurred that almost every person of talent and eminence
then living fell, or has since fallen, more or less under
the suspicion of being Junius. But his own words to Woodfall
have as yet proved true:—“It is not in the nature of things
that you or anybody else should know me, unless I make myself
known.” He adds that he never will do so. “I am the
sole depository of my secret, and it shall die with me.” If it
has not died with him, he at least has gone to the grave without
its divulgement by himself. But there may still be circumstantial
evidence sufficient to betray him, in despite of all
his secretive care.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Rush’s <cite>Residence at the Court of London</cite> is preserved
an anecdote relating to the authorship of Junius, of interest
and apparent importance to the investigators of this vexed
question. It is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Canning related an anecdote pertinent to the topic, derived
from the present king when Prince of Wales. It was to
the following effect. The late king was in the habit of going
to the theatre once a week at the time Junius’s Letters were
appearing, and had a page in his service of the name of Ramus.
This page always brought the play-bill in to the king at teatime,
on the evenings when he went. On the evening before
Sir Philip Francis sailed for India, Ramus handed to the king,
at the same time when delivering the play-bill, a note from
Garrick to Ramus, in which the former stated that there would
be no more letters from Junius. This was found to be the very
night on which Junius addressed his laconic note to Garrick,
threatening him with vengeance. Sir Philip did embark for
India next morning, and in point of fact the letters ceased to
appear from that very day. The anecdote added that there
lived with Sir Philip at the time a relation of Ramus, who
sailed in the morning with him. The whole narrative excited
much attention, and was new to most of the company. The first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>impression it made was, not only that it went far towards showing,
by proof almost direct, that Sir Philip Francis was the
author, but that Garrick must have been in the secret.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Bengal Hurkaru</cite>, a Calcutta paper, dated Feb. 19, 1855,
contains the following paragraph, which is the more interesting
when taken in conjunction with several facts connected with
Francis’s residence there, as a member of the council, for
several years (1774–80).</p>

<p class='c000'>“The <cite>Englishman</cite> (a military newspaper published in Calcutta)
states that there is a gentleman in Calcutta who possesses
‘an original document, the publication of which would
forever set at rest the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexata quæstio</span></i> as to the authorship of the
<cite>Letters of Junius</cite>.’ The document which we have seen is
what our cotemporary describes it to be, and bears three signatures:
that of ‘Chatham,’ on the right-hand side of the paper;
and on the left, those of Dr. Wilmot, and J. Dunning, afterwards
Lord Ashburton. The paper, the ink, and the writing
all induce us to believe that the document is genuine; and we
understand that the gentleman in whose possession it is has
other documentary evidence corroborative of this, which still
further tends to clear up the riddle which so many have attempted
to read with small success.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The incident related by Mr. Canning acquires additional
value and significance when considered in connection with the
evidence in favor of Francis, so concisely drawn up by Macaulay
in his Essay on the impeachment of Warren Hastings.
After an introductory allusion to the disputed authorship, Macaulay
goes on to say:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The external evidence is, we think, such as would support a
verdict in a civil, nay, in a criminal, proceeding. The handwriting
of Junius is the very peculiar handwriting of Francis,
slightly disguised. As to the position, pursuits, and connections
of Junius, the following are the most important facts
which can be considered as clearly proved: first, that he was
acquainted with the technical forms of the Secretary of State’s
office; secondly, that he was intimately acquainted with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>business of the War Office; thirdly, that he, during the year
1770, attended debates in the House of Lords, and took notes
of speeches, particularly of the speeches of Lord Chatham;
fourthly, that he bitterly resented the appointment of Mr.
Chamier to the place of Deputy Secretary at War; fifthly, that
he was bound by some strong tie to the first Lord Holland.
Now, Francis passed some years in the Secretary of State’s
office. He was subsequently chief clerk of the War Office. He
repeatedly mentioned that he had himself, in 1770, heard
speeches of Lord Chatham; and some of those speeches were
actually printed from his notes. He resigned his clerkship at
the War Office from resentment at the appointment of Mr. Chamier.
It was by Lord Holland that he was first introduced
into the public service. Now, here are five marks, all of which
ought to be found in Junius. They are all five found in Francis.
We do not believe that more than two of them can be
found in any other person whatever. If this argument does
not settle the question, there is an end of all reasoning on circumstantial
evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The internal evidence seems to us to point the same way.
The style of Francis bears a strong resemblance to that of Junius;
nor are we disposed to admit, what is generally taken for
granted, that the acknowledged compositions of Francis are
very decidedly inferior to the anonymous letters. The argument
from inferiority, at all events, is one which may be urged
with at least equal force against every claimant that has ever
been mentioned, with the single exception of Burke, who certainly
was not Junius. And what conclusion, after all, can be
drawn from mere inferiority? Every writer must produce his
best work; and the interval between his best and his second-best
work may be very wide indeed. Nobody will say that the
best letters of Junius are more decidedly superior to the acknowledged
works of Francis than three or four of Corneille’s
tragedies to the rest; than three or four of Ben Jonson’s
comedies to the rest; than the Pilgrim’s Progress to the other
works of Bunyan; than Don Quixote to the other works of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>Cervantes. Nay, it is certain that the Man in the Mask, whoever
he may have been, was a most unequal writer. To go no
further than the letters which bear the signature of Junius,—the
letter to the king and the letters to Horne Tooke have little
in common except the asperity; and asperity was an ingredient
seldom wanting either in the writings or in the speeches of
Francis.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, one of the strongest reasons for believing that Francis
was Junius is the moral resemblance between the two men. It
is not difficult from the letters which, under various signatures,
are known to have been written by Junius, and from his dealings
with Woodfall and others, to form a tolerably correct notion
of his character. He was clearly a man not destitute of
real patriotism and magnanimity,—a man whose vices were not
of a sordid kind. But he must also have been a man in the
highest degree arrogant and insolent, a man prone to malevolence,
and prone to the error of mistaking his malevolence for
public virtue. “Doest thou well to be angry?” was the question
asked in old time of the Hebrew prophet. And he answered,
“I do well.” This was evidently the temper of Junius;
and to this cause we attribute the savage cruelty which
disgraces several of his letters. No man is so merciless as he
who, under a strong self-delusion, confounds his antipathies
with his duties. It may be added, that Junius, though allied
with the democratic party by common enmities, was the very
opposite of a democratic politician. While attacking individuals
with a ferocity which perpetually violated all the laws of
literary warfare, he regarded the most defective parts of old
institutions with a respect amounting to pedantry, pleaded
the cause of Old Sarum with fervor, and contemptuously told
the capitalists of Manchester and Leeds that, if they wanted
votes, they might buy land and become freeholders of Lancashire
and Yorkshire. All this, we believe, might stand, with
scarcely any change, for a character of Philip Francis.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not strange that the great anonymous writer should
have been willing at that time to leave the country which had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>been so powerfully stirred by his eloquence. Every thing had
gone against him. That party which he clearly preferred to
every other, the party of George Grenville, had been scattered
by the death of its chief, and Lord Suffolk had led the greater
part of it over to the ministerial benches. The ferment produced
by the Middlesex election had gone down. Every faction
must have been an object of aversion to Junius. His
opinions on domestic affairs separated him from the Ministry,
his opinions on colonial affairs from the Opposition. Under
such circumstances, he had thrown down his pen in misanthropic
despair. His farewell letter to Woodfall bears date January
19, 1773. In that letter he declared that he must be an
idiot to write again; that he had meant well by the cause and
the public; that both were given up; that there were not ten
men who would act steadily together on any question. “But
it is all alike,” he added, “vile and contemptible. You have
never flinched, that I know of; and I shall always rejoice to
hear of your prosperity.” These were the last words of Junius.
Soon afterwards Sir Philip Francis started on his voyage
to Bengal.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the ablest articles in favor of Lord Chatham may be
found in Hogg’s <cite>Instructor</cite>, already quoted from. The writer
sums up his evidence in a masterly manner, and almost conclusively,
were it not that he still leaves, like others who have preceded
him, a large space for an entering wedge. Nay, more:
he even divides the palm, and, though he gives the great William
Pitt the chief glory, he intimates that Francis not only
wrote some of the epistles, but originated “the idea of so operating
on the public mind.” He says in his closing remarks,
in answer to the question, “Had Sir Philip Francis no share
in the Junian Letters?” “He certainly was privy, we imagine,
to the <i>whole business</i>, and, indeed, very probably wrote some
of the earlier and less important epistles. He had been private
secretary to Chatham at one time, and was his friend, or rather
idolizing follower, through life. But he was not Junius. He
may even have begun the epistolary series, and may deserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_729'>729</span>the credit, perhaps, of having suggested the idea of so operating
on the public mind. But still he was not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nominis Umbra</span></i>
himself. In answering the queries of Lord Campbell, Lady
Francis, while owning that Sir Philip never called himself
Junius to her, assumes nevertheless that he was that mystic
being, but adds that after he had begun the letters a ‘new
and powerful ally’ came to his assistance. The whole mystery
is here laid bare. Lord Chatham is clearly the ally meant; and
the testimony of Lady Francis, therefore, founded on the revelations
of her husband, may be held as fully establishing our
present hypothesis.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet Francis and Chatham both “died and left no sign:” the
question is therefore still open to discussion, and, as a late
writer has remarked, it is not a mere question of curiosity.
He recommends it to the study of every barrister who wishes
to make himself acquainted with the <cite>Theory of Evidence</cite>.
There is scarcely a claim that has been put forward as yet, which
he will not find worthy of his attention, especially when he considers
the <i>remarkable coincidences</i> which have generally been
the occasion of their being brought forward. He adds that he
has during the last thirty years successively admitted the
claims of five or six of the candidates, but that now he does
not believe in one of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The original MS. of this immortal poem was lately sold at
auction in London. At a former sale (1845) it was purchased,
together with the “Odes,” by a Mr. Penn. He gave $500 for
the Elegy alone. He was proud, says the <cite>London Athenæum</cite>,
of his purchase,—so proud, indeed, that binders were employed
to inlay them on fine paper, bind them up in volumes of richly-tooled
olive morocco with silk linings, and finally enclose each
volume in a case of plain purple morocco. The order was carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_730'>730</span>carried out, and the volumes were deposited at Stoke
Pogis, in the great house adjoining the grave of Gray. The
MS. of the Elegy is full of verbal alterations: it is the only
copy known to exist, and is evidently Gray’s first grouping
together of the stanzas as a whole. As the Elegy is known
and admired by almost every one conversant with the English
language, we select some of the verses, to show the alterations
made by the author. The established text is printed in Roman
type, the MS. readings as originally written, in Italics:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In the original manuscript copy, after the eighteenth stanza,
are the four following verses, which were evidently intended to
complete the poem, but the idea of the hoary-headed swain
occurring to the author, he rejected them:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The thoughtless world to majesty may bow,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Exalt the brave and idolize success;</div>
      <div class='line'>But more to innocence their safety owe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Than power or genius ere conspired to bless.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And thou who, mindful of the unhonored dead,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Dost in these notes their artless tale relate;</div>
      <div class='line'>By night and lonely contemplation led</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To wander in the gloomy walks of fate:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hark! how the sacred calm that breathes around</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bids every fierce, tumultuous passion cease,</div>
      <div class='line'>In still, small accents breathing from the ground</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A grateful earnest of eternal peace.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>No more with reason and thyself at strife,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Give anxious cares and endless wishes room;</div>
      <div class='line'>But through the cool sequestered vale of life</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Pursue the silent tenor of thy doom.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After the twenty-fifth stanza was the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Him have we seen the greenwood side along,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>While o’er the heath we hied, our labor done,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_732'>732</span>Oft as the woodlark piped her farewell song,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With wistful eyes pursue the setting sun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Preceding the epitaph was the following beautiful allusion
to the rustic tomb of the village scholar:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There scattered oft, the earliest of the year,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>By hands unseen, are showers of violets found;</div>
      <div class='line'>The redbreast loves to build and warble there,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And little footsteps lightly print the ground.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Gray began the composition of this exquisite poem in 1742;
but so carefully did he proceed, that it remained on his hands
for seven years. It is believed to have been mostly written
within the precincts of the church at Granchester, about two
miles from Cambridge; and the curfew in the poet’s mind was
accordingly the great bell of St. Mary’s, tolled regularly every
evening at nine o’clock in Gray’s time and since.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a piece of finished composition, possessing all the elements
of true poetry, in conception, in illustration, in the mechanical
structure of the verse, in the simplicity of the style,
in the touching nature of the ideas, the Elegy won from the
outset a fame which, as a century of time has but served to
make it more certain and more illustrious, is likely to last as
long as mankind have the feelings of mortality.</p>

<p class='c000'>As illustrations of the popularity of this poem, we may cite
two historical incidents that will be interesting and acceptable
to the reader.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the night of September 13, 1759,—the night before the
capture of Quebec by the English,—as the boats were floating
down the river to the appointed landing, under cover of the
night, and in the stillness of a silence constrained on pain of
death, Gen. Wolfe, just arisen from a bed of sickness, harassed
with the anxieties of a protracted yet fruitless campaign, and his
mind filled with the present hazard, slowly and softly repeated
its soothing lines; and he added to the officers around him,
“Now, gentlemen, I would prefer being the author of that
poem to the glory of beating the French to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the night of October 23, 1852,—the night before Daniel
Webster’s death,—the great statesman, having already been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_733'>733</span>informed by his medical attendant that nothing further could
be done, except to render his last hours more quiet, said, somewhat
indistinctly, the words, “Poetry, poetry,—Gray, Gray!”
His son repeated the opening line of the Elegy, and Mr. Webster
said, “That is it! that is it!” The volume was brought,
and several stanzas of the poem were read to him, which gave
him evident pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the many who have sought notoriety by pinning
themselves to the skirts of Gray is a Mr. Edwards, author of
<cite>The Canons of Criticism</cite>. This gentleman, though a bachelor,
was more attentive to the fair sex than the pindaric Elegist,
and, thinking there was a defect in the immortal poem that
should be supplied, wrote the following creditable stanzas,
which remind one of <cite>Maud Muller</cite>, to be introduced immediately
after “some Cromwell guiltless,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Some lovely fair, whose unaffected charms</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Shone forth, attraction in herself unknown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose beauty might have blest a monarch’s arms,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And virtue cast a lustre on a throne.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That humble beauty warmed an honest heart</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And cheered the labors of a faithful spouse;</div>
      <div class='line'>That virtue formed for every decent part</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The healthful offspring that adorned their house.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The following beautiful imitation, by an American poet, is the
best that has ever been offered to supply another remarkable
deficiency,—the absence of such reflections on the sublime
truths and inspiring hopes of Christianity as the scene would
naturally awaken in a pious mind. With the exception of
two or three somewhat equivocal expressions, Gray says
scarcely a word which might not have been said by any one
who believed that death is an eternal sleep, and who was
disposed to regard the humble tenants of those tombs as
indeed “each in his narrow cell <i>forever</i> laid.” A supplement
according so well with the Elegy, both in elevation of sentiment
and force of diction, as the following, might appropriately
have followed the stanza,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_734'>734</span>No airy dreams their simple fancies fired,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>No thirst for wealth, nor panting after fame;</div>
      <div class='line'>But truth divine sublimer hopes inspired,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And urged them onward to a nobler aim.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From every cottage, with the day, arose</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The hallowed voice of spirit-breathing prayer;</div>
      <div class='line'>And artless anthems, at its peaceful close,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Like holy incense, charmed the evening air.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though they, each tome of human lore unknown,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The brilliant path of science never trod,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sacred volume claimed their hearts alone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Which taught the way to glory and to God.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here they from truth’s eternal fountain drew</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The pure and gladdening waters, day by day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Learned, since our days are evil, fleet, and few,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To walk in Wisdom’s bright and peaceful way.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In yon lone pile o’er which hath sternly passed</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The heavy hand of all-destroying Time,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through whose low mouldering aisles now sigh the blest,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And round whose altars grass and ivy climb,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They gladly thronged, their grateful hymns to raise,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Oft as the calm and holy Sabbath shone;</div>
      <div class='line'>The mingled tribute of their prayers and praise</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In sweet communion rose before the throne.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here, from those honored lips which sacred fire</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From Heaven’s high chancery hath touched, they hear</div>
      <div class='line'>Truths which their zeal inflame, their hopes inspire,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Give wings to faith, and check affliction’s tear.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When life flowed by, and, like an angel, Death</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Came to release them to the world on high,</div>
      <div class='line'>Praise trembled still on each expiring breath,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And holy triumph beamed from every eye.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then gentle hands their “dust to dust” consign;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With quiet tears, the simple rites are said,</div>
      <div class='line'>And here they sleep, till at the trump divine</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The earth and ocean render up their dead.</div>

<h3 class='c012'>SCENE FROM THE PARTING INTERVIEW OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>From the manuscript of Pope’s translation of Homer’s Iliad
we select a passage, with its alterations and emendations, characteristic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_735'>735</span>like those of the foregoing, of the taste and precision
of the author. It is interesting to note the variety of
epithets, the imperfect idea, the gradual embellishment, and the
critical erasures. But in their contemplation, rather than say,
with Waller,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Poets lose half the praise they should have got,</div>
      <div class='line'>Could it be known what they discreetly blot,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>we should feel with Dr. Johnson, who remarked, upon examining
the MSS. of Milton, that “such relics show how excellence
is acquired: what we hope ever to do with ease we must learn
first to do with diligence.” Johnson himself employed the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">limæ laborem</span></i> on <cite>The Rambler</cite> to an extent almost incredible,
and, according to Boswell, unknown in the annals of literature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Nash remarks that it is more difficult, and requires a
greater mastery of art, in painting to foreshorten a figure exactly
than to draw three at their just length; so it is more
difficult in writing, to express any thing naturally and briefly
than to enlarge and dilate.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>And therefore a judicious author’s blots</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Are more ingenious than his first free thoughts.</div>

    <div class='group'>

<h3 class='c012'>POPE’S VERSIFICATION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The mechanical structure of Pope’s verses may be shown by
omitting dissyllabic qualifying words, which are comparatively
unimportant, and converting a ten-syllable into an eight-syllable
metre, as in the following examples. First read the full text
as in the original, and then read with the words in brackets
omitted:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Kill not the king, ’tis good to fear the worst.</div>
      <div class='line'>Unpointed as it is, thus shall it go, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Collier appends the following note:—</p>

<p class='c018'>Sir J. Harington has an Epigram [L. i., E. 33] “Of writing with double
pointing,” which is thus introduced:—“It is said that King Edward, of
Carnarvon, lying at Berkely Castle, prisoner, a cardinal wrote to his
keeper, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Edwardum occidere noli, timere bonum est</span></i>, which being read with
the point at <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">timere</span></i>, it cost the king his life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The French have a proverb, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Faute d’un point Martin perdit
son ane</span></i>, (through want of a point [or stop] Martin lost
his ass,) equivalent to the English saying, <i>A miss is as good as
a mile</i>. This proverb originated from the following circumstance:—A
priest named Martin, being appointed abbot of a
religious house called Asello, directed this inscription to be
placed over his gate:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta patens esto, nulli claudatur honesto.</span></span></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(Gate, be thou open,—to no honest man be shut.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the ignorant painter, by placing the stop after the word
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nulli</span></i>, entirely altered the sense of the verse, which then stood
thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gate, be open to none;—be shut against every honest man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Pope being informed of this uncharitable inscription, took
up the matter in a very serious light, and deposed the abbot.
His successor was careful to correct the punctuation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_739'>739</span>verse, to which the following line was added:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Pro solo puncto caruit Martinus Asello.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>(For a single stop Martin lost Asello.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The word Asello having an equivocal sense, signifying an
ass as well as the name of the abbey, its former signification
has been adopted in the proverb.</p>

<p class='c000'>A nice point has recently occupied the attention of the
French courts of law. Mons. de M. died on the 27th of
February, leaving a will, entirely in his own handwriting,
which he concludes thus:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“And to testify my affection for my nephews Charles and
Henri de M., I bequeath to each <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’eux</span></i> [i.e. <i>of them</i>] [or
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">deux</span></i>, i.e. <i>two</i>] hundred thousand francs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The paper was folded before the ink was dry, and the
writing is blotted in many places. The legatees assert that
the apostrophe is one of those blots; but the son and heir-at-law
maintains, on the contrary, that the apostrophe is intentional.
This apostrophe is worth to him two hundred thousand
francs; and the difficulty is increased by the fact that
there is nothing in the context that affords any clew to the
real intention of the testator.</p>

<p class='c000'>Properly punctuated, the following nonsense becomes sensible
rhyme, and is doubtless as true as it is curious, though as it
now stands it is very curious if true:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>And will confirm what I tell you.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The following is a good example of the unintelligible, produced
by the want of pauses in their right places:—</p>

      <div class='line'>And this is true without deceit.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Punctuated thus, the true meaning will at once appear:—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Every lady in this land</div>

      <div class='line'>And this is true without deceit.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The wife of a mariner about to sail on a distant voyage sent
a note to the clergyman of the parish, expressing the following
meaning:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A husband going to sea, his wife desires the prayers of the
congregation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately, the good matron was not skilled in punctuation,
nor had the minister quick vision. He read the note as
it was written:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A husband going to see his wife, desires the prayers of the
congregation.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Horace Smith, speaking of the ancient Oracles, says, “If
the presiding deities had not been shrewd punsters, or able to
inspire the Pythoness with ready equivoques, the whole establishment
must speedily have been declared bankrupt. Sometimes
they only dabbled in accentuation, and accomplished
their prophecies by the transposition of a stop, as in the well-known
answer to a soldier inquiring his fate in the war for
which he was about to embark. <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibis, redibis. Nunquam
in bello peribis.</span></span> (You will go, you will return. Never in
war will you perish.) The warrior set off in high spirits upon
the faith of this prediction, and fell in the first engagement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_741'>741</span>when his widow had the satisfaction of being informed that
he should have put the full stop after the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nunquam</span></i>,
which would probably have put a <i>full stop</i> to his enterprise
and saved his life.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>INDIAN HERALDRY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A sanguine Frenchman had so high an opinion of the pleasure
to be enjoyed in the study of heraldry, that he used to
lament, as we are informed by Menage, the hard case of our
forefather Adam, who could not possibly amuse himself by investigating
that science or that of genealogy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A similar instance of egregious preference for a favorite
study occurs in a curious work on Heraldry, published in London,
in 1682, the author of which adduces, as an argument of
the science of heraldry being founded on the universal propensities
of human nature, the fact of having seen some American
Indians with their skins tattooed in stripes parallel and crossed
(barries). The book bears the following title:—<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Introductio ad
Latinam Blasoniam. Authore Johanne Gibbono Armorumservulo
quem a mantilio dicunt Cæruleo.</span></cite> The singular and
amusing extract appended is copied from page 156:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The book entitled <cite>Jews in America</cite> tells you that the
sachem and chief princes of the Nunkyganses, in New England,
submitted to King Charles I., subscribing their names,
and setting their seals, which were a <span class='fss'>BOW BENT</span>, <span class='fss'>CHARGED
WITH AN ARROW</span>, <span class='sc'>a T reversed</span>, <span class='fss'>A TOMAHAWK OR HATCHET
ERECTED</span>, such a one borne <span class='fss'>BARRYWISE</span>, edge downward, and a
<span class='fss'>FAWN</span>. A great part of Anno 1659, till February the year
following, I lived in Virginia, being most hospitably entertained
by the honorable Col. R. Lee, sometime secretary of state
there, and who after the king’s martyrdom hired a Dutch
vessel, freighted her himself, and went to Brussels, surrendered
up Sir William Barclaie’s old commission (for the government
of that Province), and received a new one from his present
majesty (a loyal action, and deserving my commemoration):
neither will I omit his arms, being <span class='sc'>Gul. a Fes. chequy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_742'>742</span>or, Bl between eight billets Arg.</span> being descended from
the Lees of Shropshire, who sometimes bore eight <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">billets</span></i>, sometimes
ten, and sometimes the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fesse Contercompone</span></i> (as I have
seen by our office-records). I will blason it thus: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>In Clypeo rutilo;
Fasciam pluribus quadratis auri et cyani, alternis æquisque
spaciis</i> (<i>ducter triplici positis</i>) <i>confectam et inter octo
Plinthides argenteas collocatam</i>.</span> I say, while I lived in Virginia,
I saw once a war-dance acted by the natives. The dancers
were painted some <span class='sc'>party per pale Gul. et sab.</span> from forehead
to foot (some <span class='fss'>PARTY PER FESSE</span>, of the same colors), and
carried little ill-made shields of bark, also painted of those
colors (for I saw no other), some <span class='fss'>PARTY PER FESSE</span>, some <span class='fss'>PER
PALE</span> (and some <span class='fss'>BARRY</span>), at which I exceedingly wondered,
and concluded that heraldry was engrafted naturally into the
sense of the human race. If so, it deserves a greater esteem
than is now-a-days put upon it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE ANACHRONISMS OF SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Poets, in the proper exercise of their art, may claim greater
license of invention and speech, and far greater liberty of illustration
and embellishment, than is allowed to the sober writer
of history; but historical truth or chronological accuracy should
not be entirely sacrificed to dramatic effect, especially when the
poem is founded upon history, or designed generally to represent
historical truth. In the matchless works of Shakspeare
we look instinctively for exactness in the details of time, place,
and circumstance; and it is therefore with no little surprise
that we find he has misplaced, in such instances as the following,
the chronological order of events, of the true state of
which it can hardly be supposed he was ignorant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the play of <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, Titus Lartius is made to say,
addressing C. Marcius,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thou wast a soldier even to <cite>Cato’s</cite> wish.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a little curious how Marcius could have been a soldier
to “Cato’s wish,” for Marcius, surnamed Coriolanus, was banished
from Rome and died more than two hundred years before
Cato’s eyes first saw the light. In the same play Menenius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_743'>743</span>says of Marcius, “He sits in his state as a thing made for
Alexander,” or like Alexander. The anachronism made in
this case is almost as bad as that just given, for Coriolanus was
banished from Rome and died not far from <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 490, and
Alexander was not born until almost one hundred and fifty
years after. And the poet in the same play makes still another
error in the words which he puts in the mouth of Menenius:—“The
most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic.”
Now, as the renowned “father of medicine” was not
born until <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 130, of which fact it seems hardly probable
that Shakspeare could have been ignorant, he has overleaped
more than six hundred years to introduce Galen to his readers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the tragedy of <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> occurs a historical inaccuracy
which cannot be excused on the ground of dramatic
effect. It must be imputed to downright carelessness. It is
in the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Brutus.</i> Peace! count the clock.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Cassius.</i> The clock has stricken three.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Cassius and Brutus both must have been endowed with the
vision of a prophet, for the first striking clock was not introduced
into Europe until more than eight hundred years after
they had been laid in their graves. And in the tragedy of
<cite>King Lear</cite> there is an inaccuracy, in regard to spectacles, as
great as that in <cite>Julius Cæsar</cite> respecting clocks. King Lear
was king of Britain in the early Anglo-Saxon period of
English history; yet Gloster, commanding his son to show him
a letter which he holds in his hands, says, “Come, let’s see:
if it be nothing, I shall not want spectacles.” It is generally
admitted that spectacles were not worn in Europe until the
end of the thirteenth or the commencement of the fourteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shakspeare also anticipates in at least two plays, and by
many years, the important event of the first use of cannon in
battle or siege. In his great tragedy of <cite>Macbeth</cite>, he speaks
of cannon “overcharged with double cracks;” and <i>King John</i>
says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_744'>744</span>Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France,</div>
      <div class='line'>For ere thou canst report, I will be there;</div>
      <div class='line'>The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Cannon, it will be recollected, were first used at Cressy, in
1346, whereas Macbeth was killed in 1054, and John did not
begin to reign until 1199. In the <cite>Comedy of Errors</cite>, the
scene of which is laid in the ancient city of Ephesus, mention
is made of modern denominations of money, as guilders and
ducats; also of a striking clock, and a nunnery.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHAKSPEARE’S HEROINES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Ruskin says:—Shakspeare has no heroes—he has only heroines.
There is not one entirely heroic figure in all his plays, except
the slight sketch of Henry the Fifth, exaggerated for the purposes
of the stage, and the still slighter Valentine in the <cite>Two
Gentlemen of Verona</cite>. In his labored and perfect plays you
have no hero. Othello would have been one, if his simplicity
had not been so great as to leave him the prey of every base practice
around him; but he is the only example even approximating
the heroic type. Hamlet is indolent and drowsily speculative;
Romeo an impatient boy. Whereas there is hardly a
play that has not a perfect woman in it, steadfast in grave hope
and errorless purpose. Cordelia, Desdemona, Isabella, Hermione,
Imogene, Queen Katherine, Perdita, Silvia, Viola, Rosalind,
Helena, and last, and perhaps loveliest, Virgilia, are all faultless.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHAKSPEARE AND TYPOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The great Caxton authority in England—Mr. William Blades—has
turned his attention to Shakspeare, and applies his knowledge
as a practical printer to the poet’s works, in order to see
what acquaintance they show with the compositor’s art. The
result is strikingly set forth in a volume entitled “<cite>Shakspeare
and Typography</cite>.” Many instances of the use of technical terms
by Shakspeare are cited by Mr. Blades, such as the following:—</p>

<p class='c018'>1. “Come we to <i>full points</i> here? And are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et ceteras</span></i> nothing?—<cite>2 Henry
IV.</cite>, ii. 4.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_745'>745</span>2. “If a book is folio, and two pages of type have been composed, they
are placed in proper position upon the imposing stone, and enclosed within
an iron or steel frame, called a ‘chase,’ small wedges of hard wood, termed
‘coigns’ or ‘quoins,’ being driven in at opposite sides to make all tight.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By the four opposing <i>coigns</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Which the world together joins.—Pericles, iii. 1.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This is just the description of a form in folio, where two quoins
on one side are always opposite to two quoins on the other, thus
together joining and tightening all the separate stamps.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHAKSPEARE’S SONNETS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Schlegel says that sufficient use has not been made of
Shakspeare’s Sonnets as important materials for his biography.
Let us see to what conclusions they may lead us. In Sonnet
<span class='fss'>XXXVII.</span>, for example, he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>As a decrepit father takes delight</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To see his active child do deeds of youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>So I, <i>made lame</i> by fortune’s dearest spite,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And again, in Sonnet <span class='fss'>LXXXIX.</span>,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And I will comment upon that offence;</div>
      <div class='line'>Speak of my <i>lameness</i>, and I straight will halt,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Against thy reasons making no defence.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Was Shakspeare lame? “A question to be asked;” and
there is nothing in the inquiry repugnant to poetic justice, for
he has made Julius Cæsar deaf in his left ear. Where did he
get his authority?</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HAMLET’S AGE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Shakspeare’s Hamlet was thirty years old, as is indicated by
the text in Act. V. Sc. 1:—</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Ham.</span> How long hast thou been a grave-maker?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>1 Clo.</span> Of all the days i’ the year, I came to’t that day that our last King
Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>Ham.</span> How long is that since?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>1 Clo.</span> Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that: it was the very
day that young Hamlet was born: he that is mad and sent into England.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_746'>746</span><span class='sc'>Ham.</span> Upon what ground?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>1 Clo.</span> Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy
thirty years.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HAMLET’S INSANITY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>It is strange that there should be any doubts whether Hamlet
was really or feignedly insane. His assertion to the Queen,
after putting off his assumed tricks (iii. 4.),</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That I essentially am not in madness,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>But mad in craft</i>,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>is surely admissible testimony. But he gives us other evidence
based upon the difficulty of <i>recalling a train of thought</i>, an invariable
accompaniment of insanity, inasmuch as it is an act in
which both brains are concerned. He says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Bring me to the test,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I the matter will re-word; which madness</div>
      <div class='line'>Would gambol from.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There are no instances of insanity on record, however slight
and uncognizable by any but an experienced medical man,
where the patient, after relating a short history of his complaints,
physical, moral, and social, could, on being requested to
reiterate the narrative, follow the same series, and repeat the
same words, even with the limited correctness of a sane person.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>ADDITIONAL VERSES TO HOME, SWEET HOME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the winter of 1833, John Howard Payne, the author of
<cite>Home, Sweet Home</cite>, called upon an American lady, the wife
of an eminent banker living in London, and presented to her a
copy of the original, set to music, with the two following additional
verses addressed to her:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line in6'>There’s no place like home!</div>

<h3 class='c012'>THE STEREOTYPED FALSITIES OF HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Thinking to amuse my father once, after his retirement from the ministry,
I offered to read a book of history. “Any thing but history,” said he; “for
history must be false.”—<cite>Walpoliana.</cite></p>

<p class='c000'>What massive volumes would the reiterated errors and falsities
of history fill, could they be collected in one grand <i>omniana</i>!
Historians in every period of the world, narrowed and
biassed by surrounding circumstances, each in his pent-up Utica
confined, have lacked the fairness and impartiality necessary to
insure a full conviction of their truthfulness. Men not only
suffer their opinions and their prejudices to mislead themselves
and others, but frequently, in the absence of material, draw
upon their imaginations for <i>facts</i>. Often, too, when sincerely
desirous of presenting the truth so as to “nothing extenuate,
nor set down aught in malice,” the sources of their information
are lamentably deficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discrepancies of historical writers are very remarkable.
If one who had never heard of Napoleon were to read Scott’s
Life of the great military chieftain, and then read Abbott’s
work, in what a maze of perplexity would he be involved between
the disparagement of the one and the deification of the
other! If one writer asserts that the Duke of Clarence was
drowned in a butt of malmsey in the Tower of London, and
another derisively treats it as a “childish improbability,” and
if one expresses the belief that Richard of Gloucester exerted
himself to save Clarence, and another that he was the actual
murderer, <i>who</i>, or <i>what</i>, are we to believe?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_748'>748</span>Knowing, as we do, that modern history abounds with errors,
what are we to think of ancient history? If fraudulent and
erroneous statements can be distinctly pointed out in Hume,
and Lingard, and Alison, how far can we place any reliance
upon Cæsar, and Herodotus, and Xenophon?</p>

<p class='c000'>The monstrous absurdities and incongruities related of Xerxes,
which have descended to our day under the name of history,
are too stupendous for any credulity. The imposture, like
vaulting ambition, “o’erleaps itself.” Such extravagant demands
upon our faith serve to deepen our doubt of alleged occurrences
that lie more nearly within the range of possibility.
<i>If it be true</i> that Hannibal cut his way across the Alps with
“<i>fire, iron, and vinegar</i>,” how did he apply the vinegar?</p>

<p class='c000'>If falsities in our American history can creep upon us whilst
our eyes are open to surrounding evidence, is it to be wondered
at that there are so many contradictions and so many myths in
the history of Rome? The very name <i>America</i> is a deception,
a fraud, and a perpetuation of as rank injustice as ever stained
the annals of human events. It is to be hoped that the time
will yet come when Columbus shall receive his due. When that
millennial day arrives which will insist on calling things by
their right names, the battle of Bunker’s Hill will be called
the battle of Breed’s Hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems incredible, and it certainly is singular, that so many
errors in our history should continue to prevail in utter defiance
of what is known to be fact. Historians, for instance, persist
in saying, and people consequently persist in believing, that the
breast-works of General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans
were made of cotton-bales covered with earth, whilst intelligent
survivors strenuously deny that there was a pound of that combustible
material on the ground.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> A well-known painting frequently</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_749'>749</span>copied by line-engravers represents Lord Cornwallis
handing his sword to General Washington, at the surrender of
Yorktown, and this in spite of the glaring fact that, to spare
Cornwallis that humiliation, General O’Hara gave his sword to
General Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blood shed at the battle of Lexington is commonly believed
and said to have been the <i>first</i> drawn in the contest of
the Colonists with the oppressive authorities of the British
Government. Aside from the Boston massacre, which occurred
March 5, 1770, it will be found, by reference to the records
of Orange county, North Carolina, that a body of men was
formed, called the “Regulators,” with the view of resisting
the extortion of Colonel Fanning, clerk of the court, and other
officers, who demanded illegal fees, issued false deeds, levied
unauthorized taxes, &amp;c.; that these men went to the court-house
at Hillsboro’, appointed a schoolmaster named York as
clerk, set up a mock judge, and pronounced judgment in
mock gravity and ridicule of the court, law, and officers, by
whom they felt themselves aggrieved; that soon after, the
house, barn, and out-buildings of the judge were burned to
the ground; and that Governor Tryon subsequently, with a
small force, went to suppress the Regulators, with whom an
engagement took place near Alamance Creek, on the road from
Hillsboro’ to Salisbury, on the 16th of May, 1771,—nearly
four years before the affair of Lexington,—in which nine
Regulators and twenty-seven militia were killed, and many
wounded,—fourteen of the latter being killed by one man,
James Pugh, from behind a rock.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_750'>750</span>The progress of the natural and physical sciences, together
with the increased facilities of intercommunication by
steam, have done much towards disproving and exposing the
fabulous stories of travelers. The extravagant character, for
example, of the assertions of Fœrsch and Darwin in regard to
the noxious emanations of the Bohun Upas is now shown by
the fact that a specimen of it growing at Chiswick, England,
may be approached with safety, and even handled, with a little
precaution. It is equally well established that the famous Poison
Valley in the island of Java affords the most remarkable
natural example yet known of an atmosphere overloaded with
carbonic acid gas, to which must be referred the destructive influence
upon animal life heretofore attributed to the Upas-tree.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CONFLICTING TESTIMONY OF EYE-WITNESSES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Sir Walter Raleigh, in his prison, was composing the second
volume of his History of the World. Leaning on the sill of his
window, he meditated on the duties of the historian to mankind,
when suddenly his attention was attracted by a disturbance in
the court-yard before his cell. He saw one man strike another,
whom he supposed by his dress to be an officer; the latter at once
drew his sword and ran the former through the body. The
wounded man felled his adversary with a stick, and then sank
upon the pavement. At this juncture the guard came up and
carried off the officer insensible, and then the corpse of the
man who had been run through.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next day Raleigh was visited by an intimate friend, to whom
he related the circumstances of the quarrel and its issue. To
his astonishment, his friend unhesitatingly declared that the
prisoner had mistaken the whole series of incidents which had
passed before his eyes. The supposed officer was not an officer
at all, but the servant of a foreign ambassador; it was he who
had dealt the first blow; he had not drawn his sword, but the
other had snatched it from his side, and had run <i>him</i> through
the body before any one could interfere; whereupon a stranger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_751'>751</span>from among the crowd knocked the murderer down with his
stick, and some of the foreigners belonging to the ambassador’s
retinue carried off the corpse. The friend of Raleigh added that
government had ordered the arrest and immediate trial of the
murderer, as the man assassinated was one of the principal
servants of the Spanish ambassador.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Excuse me,” said Raleigh, “but I cannot have been deceived
as you suppose, for I was eye-witness to the events which took
place under my own window, and the man fell there on that spot
where you see a paving-stone standing up above the rest.”
“My dear Raleigh,” replied his friend, “I was sitting on that
stone when the fray took place, and I received this slight scratch
on my cheek in snatching the sword from the murderer, and
upon my word of honor, you have been deceived upon every
particular.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Walter, when alone, took up the second volume of his
History, which was in MS., and contemplating it, thought—“If
I cannot believe my own eyes, how can I be assured of the
truth of a tithe of the events which happened ages before I
was born?” and he flung the manuscript into the fire.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WIT AND HUMOR.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The distinction between wit and humor may be said to consist
in this,—that the characteristic of the latter is Nature, and of
the former Art. Wit is more allied to intellect, and humor to
imagination. Humor is a higher, finer, and more genial thing
than wit. It is a combination of the laughable with tenderness,
sympathy, and warm-heartedness. Pure wit is often ill-natured,
and has a sting; but wit, sweetened by a kind, loving expression,
becomes humor. Wit is usually brief, sharp, epigrammatic, and
incisive, the fewer words the better; but humor, consisting more
in the manner, is diffuse, and words are not spared in it. Carlyle
says, “The essence of humor is sensibility, warm, tender fellow-feeling
with all forms of existence;” and adds, of Jean Paul’s
humor, that “in Richter’s smile itself a touching pathos may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_752'>752</span>lie hid too deep for tears.” Wit may be considered as the distinctive
feature of the French genius, and humor of the English;
but to show how difficult it is to carry these distinctions out
fairly, we may note that England has produced a Butler, one of
the greatest of wits, and France a Molière, one of the greatest
of humorists. Fun includes all those things that occasion laughter
which are not included in the two former divisions. Buffoonery
and mimicry come under this heading, and it has been observed
that the author of a comedy is a wit, the comic actor a
humorist, and the clown a buffoon. Old jests were usually tricks,
and in coarse times we find that little distinction is made between
joyousness and a malicious delight in the misfortunes of others.
Civilization discountenances practical jokes, and refinement is
required to keep laughter within bounds. As the world grows
older, fun becomes less boisterous, and wit gains in point, so that
we cannot agree with Cornelius O’Dowd when he says, “The
day of witty people is gone by. If there be men clever enough
nowadays to say smart things, they are too clever to say them.
The world we live in prefers placidity to brilliancy, and a man
like Curran in our present-day society would be as unwelcome
as a pyrotechnist with a pocket full of squibs.” This is only a
repetition of an old complaint, and its incorrectness is proved
when we find the same thing said one hundred years ago. In
a manuscript comedy, “In Foro,” by Lady Houstone, who died
near the end of the last century, one of the characters observes:
“Wit is nowadays out of fashion; people are well-bred, and
talk upon a level; one does not at present find wit but in some
old comedy.” In spite of Mr. Lever and Lady Houstone, we
believe that civilized society is specially suited for the display
of refined wit. Under such conditions satire is sure to flourish,
for the pen takes the place of the sword, and we know it can
slay an enemy as surely as steel. This notion owes its origin
in part to an error in our mental perspective, by which we bring
the wit of all ages to one focus, fancying what was really far
apart to have been close together, and thus comparing things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_753'>753</span>which possess no proper elements of comparison, and placing
as it were in opposition to each other the accumulated, broad,
and well-storied tapestry of the past with the fleeting moments
of our day, which are but its still accumulating fringe. Charles
Lamb will not allow any great antiquity for wit, and apostrophizing
candle-light says: “This is our peculiar and household
planet; wanting it, what savage, unsocial nights must our ancestors
have spent, wintering in eaves and unillumined fastnesses!
They must have laid about and grumbled at one another in
the dark. What repartees could have passed, when you must
have felt about for a smile, and handled a neighbor’s cheek
to be sure he understood it! Jokes came in with candles.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AN OLD PAPER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The most amusing and remarkable paper ever printed was
the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Muse Historique</span></cite>, or Rhyming Gazette of Jacques Loret,
which, for fifteen years, from 1650 to 1665, was issued weekly
in Paris. It consisted of 550 verses summarizing the week’s
news in rhyme, and treated of every class of subjects, grave
and gay. Loret computed, in 1663, the thirteenth year of his
enterprise, that he had written over 300,000 verses, and found
more than 700 different exordiums, for he never twice began
his Gazette with the same <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entère</span></i> in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matier</span></i>. He ran about the
city for his own news, never failed to write good verses upon it,
and never had anybody to help him, and his prolonged and always
equal performance has been pronounced unique in the
history of journalism.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>COMFORT FOR BOOK LOVERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Ruskin vigorously defends the bibliomaniac, in his <cite>Sesame
and Lilies</cite>. We have despised literature. What do we,
as a nation, care about books? How much do you think we
spend altogether on our libraries, public or private, as compared
with what we spend on our horses? If a man spends lavishly
on his library you call him mad—a bibliomaniac. But you
never call one a horse-maniac, though men ruin themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_754'>754</span>every day by their horses; and you do not hear of people ruining
themselves by their books. Or, to go lower still, how much
do you think the contents of the book-shelves of the United
Kingdom, public and private, would fetch as compared with
the contents of its wine-cellars? What position would its expenditure
on literature take as compared with its expenditure
on luxurious eating? We talk of food for the mind as of food
for the body; now, a good book contains such food inexhaustibly—it
is a provision for life, and for the best part of us; yet how
long most people would look at the best book before they would
give the price of a large turbot for it! Though there have
been men who have pinched their stomachs and bared their
backs to buy a book, whose libraries were cheaper to them, I
think, in the end, than most men’s dinners are. We are few
of us put to such trial, and more the pity; for, indeed, a precious
thing is all the more precious to us if it has been won by
work or economy; and if public libraries were half as costly as
public dinners, or books cost the tenth part of what bracelets
do, even foolish men and women might sometimes suspect there
was good in reading, as well as in munching and sparkling;
whereas the very cheapness of literature is making even wiser
people forget that if a book is worth reading it is worth
buying.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LETTERS AND THEIR ENDINGS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>There is a large gamut of choice for endings, from the official
“Your obedient servant,” and high and mighty “Your humble
servant,” to the friendly “Yours truly,” “Yours sincerely,” and
“Yours affectionately.” Some persons vary the form, and slightly
intensify the expression by placing the word “yours” last, as
“Faithfully yours.” James Howell used a great variety of endings,
such as “Yours inviolably,” “Yours entirely,” “Your entire
friend,” “Yours verily and invariably,” “Yours really,”
“Yours in no vulgar way of friendship,” “Yours to dispose of,”
“Yours while J. H.,” “Yours! Yours! Yours!” Walpole
writes: “Yours very much,” “Yours most cordially,” and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_755'>755</span>Hannah More, in 1789, “Yours more and more.” Mr. Bright,
some years ago ended a controversial letter in the following
biting terms: “I am, sir, with whatever respect is due to you.”
The old Board of Commissioners of the British Navy used a
form of subscription very different from the ordinary official one.
It was their habit to subscribe their letters (even letters of reproof)
to such officers as were not of noble families or bore titles,
“Your affectionate friends.” It is said that this practice was
discontinued in consequence of a distinguished captain adding
to his letter to the Board, “Your affectionate friend.” He was
thereupon desired to discontinue the expression, when he replied,
“I am, gentlemen, no longer your affectionate friend.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>STUDIES AND BOOKS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their
chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for ornament,
is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and
disposition of business, for expert men can execute and perhaps
judge of business one by one; but the general counsels,
and the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best from those
that are learned. To spend too much time in studies is sloth;
to use them too much for ornament is affectation; to make
judgment wholly by their rules is the humor of a scholar:
they perfect nature and are perfected by experience,—for natural
abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by study;
and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at
large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty wise
men contemn studies, simple men admire them, and wise men
use them; for they teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom
without them, and above them, won by observation. Read
not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for
granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider.
Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed,
and some few to be chewed and digested; <i>i.e.</i>, some books are
to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_756'>756</span>and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention.
Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man,
and writing an exact man; and therefore, if a man write little,
he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he had
need have a present wit; and if he read little, he had need
have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not.—<span class='sc'>Lord
Bacon.</span></p>

<h3 class='c012'>ATTAINMENTS OF LINGUISTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Taking the very highest estimate which has been offered
of their attainments, the list of those who have been reputed
to have possessed more than ten languages is a very short one.
Only four, in addition to a case that will be presently mentioned,—Mithridates,
Pico of Mirandola, Jonadab Almanor, and Sir
William Jones,—are said in the loosest sense to have passed
the limit of twenty. To the first two fame ascribes twenty-two,
to the last two twenty-eight, languages. Müller, Niebuhr,
Fulgence, Fresnel, and perhaps Sir John Bowring, are usually
set down as knowing twenty languages. For Elihu Burritt and
Csoma de Koros their admirers claim eighteen. Renaudot the
controversialist is said to have known seventeen; Professor
Lee, sixteen; and the attainments of the older linguists, as
Arius Montanus, Martin del Rio, the converted Rabbi Libettas
Cominetus, and the Admirable Crichton, are said to have ranged
from this down to ten or twelve,—most of them the ordinary
languages of learned and polite society.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extraordinary case above alluded to is that of the Cardinal
Mezzofanti, the son of a carpenter of Bologna, whose
knowledge of languages seems almost miraculous. Von Zach,
who made an occasional visit to Bologna in 1820, was accosted
by the learned priest, as he then was, in Hungarian, then in
good Saxon, and afterwards in the Austrian and Swabian dialects.
With other members of the scientific corps the priest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_757'>757</span>conversed in English, Russian, Polish, French, and Hungarian.
Von Zach mentions that his German was so natural that a cultivated
Hanoverian lady in the company expressed her surprise
that a German should be a professor and librarian in an Italian
university.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Jacobs, of Gotha, was struck not only with the
number of languages acquired by the “interpreter for Babel,”
but at the facility with which he passed from one to the other,
however opposite or cognate their structure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Tholuck heard him converse in German, Arabic, Spanish,
Flemish, English, and Swedish, received from him an original
distich in Persian, and found him studying Cornish. He heard
him say that he had studied to some extent the Quichus, or
old Peruvian, and that he was employed upon the Bimbarra.
Dr. Wiseman met him on his way to receive lessons in California
Indian from natives of that country. He heard “Nigger
Dutch” from a Curaçoa mulatto, and in less than two weeks
wrote a short piece of poetry for the mulatto to recite in his
rude tongue. He knew something of Chippewa and Delaware,
and learned the language of the Algonquin Indians. A Ceylon
student remembers many of the strangers with whom Mezzofanti
was in the habit of conversing in the Propaganda,—those whose
vernaculars were Peguan, Abyssinian, Amharic, Syriac, Arabico,
Maltese, Tamulic, Bulgarian, Albanian, besides others
already named. His facility in accommodating himself to each
new colloquist justifies the expression applied to him, as the
“chamelion of languages.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. Russell, Mezzofanti’s biographer, adopting as his definition
of a thorough knowledge of language an ability to read it
fluently and with ease, to write it correctly, and to speak it
idiomatically, sums up the following estimate of the Cardinal’s
acquisitions:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Languages frequently tested and spoken by the Cardinal
with rare excellence,—thirty.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Stated to have been spoken fluently, but hardly sufficiently
tested,—nine.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Spoken rarely and less perfectly,—eleven.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_758'>758</span>4. Spoken imperfectly; a few sentences and conversational
forms,—eight.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Studied from books, but not known to have been spoken,—fourteen.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Dialects spoken, or their peculiarities understood,—thirty-nine
dialects of ten languages, many of which might justly be
described as different languages.</p>

<p class='c000'>This list adds up one hundred and eleven, exceeding by all
comparison every thing related in history. The Cardinal said
he made it a rule to learn every new grammar and apply himself
to every strange dictionary that came within his reach.
He did not appear to consider his prodigious talent so extraordinary
as others did. “In addition to an excellent memory,”
said he, “God has blessed me with an incredible flexibility of
the organs of speech.” Another remark of his was, “that
when one has learned ten or a dozen languages essentially different
from one another, one may with a little study and attention
learn any number of them.” Again he remarked, “If
you wish to know how I preserve these languages, I can only
say that when I once hear the meaning of a word in any language
I never forget it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet it is not claimed for this man of many words that
his ideas at all corresponded. He had twenty words for one idea,
as he said of himself; but he seemed to agree with Catharine
de Medicis in preferring to have twenty ideas for one word.
He was remarkable for the number of languages which he had
made his own, but was not distinguished as a grammarian, a
lexicographer, a philologist, a philosopher, or ethnologist, and
contributed nothing to any department of the study of words,
much less that of science.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LITERARY ODDITIES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Racine composed his verses while walking about, reciting
them in a loud voice. One day, while thus working at his play
of Mithridates, in the Tuileries gardens, a crowd of workmen
gathered around him, attracted by his gestures: they took him
to be a madman about to throw himself into the basin. On his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_759'>759</span>return home from such walks he would write down scene by
scene, at first in prose, and when he had written it out, he
would exclaim, “My tragedy is done!” considering the dressing
of the acts up in verse as a very small affair. Magliabecchi,
the learned librarian to the Duke of Tuscany, on the contrary,
never stirred abroad, but lived amid books and upon
books. They were his bed, board, and washing. He passed
eight-and-forty years in their midst, only twice in the course
of his life venturing beyond the walls of Florence,—once to go
two leagues off, and the other time three and a half leagues, by
order of the Grand Duke. He was an extremely frugal man,
living upon eggs, bread, and water, in great moderation. Luther,
when studying, always had his dog lying at his feet,—a
dog he had brought from Wartburg and of which he was very
fond. An ivory crucifix stood on the table before him, and
the walls of his study were stuck round with caricatures of the
Pope. He worked at his desk for days together without
going out; but when fatigued, and the ideas began to stagnate
in his brain, he would take his flute or his guitar with
him into the porch, and there execute some musical fantasy,
(for he was a skilful musician,) when the ideas would flow
upon him as fresh as flowers after summer’s rain. Music was
his invariable solace at such times. Indeed, Luther did not
hesitate to say that, after theology, music was the first of arts.
“Music,” said he, “is the art of the prophets: it is the only
art which, like theology, can calm the agitation of the soul and
put the devil to flight.” Next to music, if not before it, Luther
loved children and flowers. The great, gnarled man had
a heart as tender as a woman’s. Calvin studied in his bed.
Every morning, at five or six o’clock, he had books, manuscripts,
and papers carried to him there, and he worked on for
hours together. If he had occasion to go out, on his return he
undressed and went to bed again to continue his studies. In
his later years he dictated his writings to secretaries. He
rarely corrected any thing. The sentences issued complete from
his mouth. If he felt his facility of composition leaving him,
he forthwith quitted his bed, gave up writing and composing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_760'>760</span>and went about his outdoor duties for days, weeks, and months
together. But as soon as he felt the inspiration fall upon him
again, he went back to his bed, and his secretary set to work
forthwith. Rousseau wrote his works early in the morning;
Le Sage at mid-day; Byron at midnight. Villehardouin rose
at four in the morning, and wrote till late at night. Aristotle
was a tremendous worker: he took little sleep, and was constantly
retrenching it. He had a contrivance by which he
awoke early, and to awake was with him to commence work.
Demosthenes passed three months in a cavern by the seaside,
laboring to overcome the defects of his voice. There he
read, studied, and declaimed. Rabelais composed his Life of
Gargantua at Bellay, in the company of Roman cardinals, and
under the eyes of the Bishop of Paris. La Fontaine wrote his
fables chiefly under the shade of a tree, and sometimes by the
side of Racine and Boileau. Pascal wrote most of his Thoughts
on little scraps of paper, at his by-moments. Fénélon wrote
his Telemachus in the Palace of Versailles, at the court of the
Grand Monarque, when discharging the duties of tutor to the
Dauphin. That a book so thoroughly democratic should have
issued from such a source and been written by a priest may
seem surprising. De Quincey first promulgated his notion of
universal freedom of person and trade, and of throwing all
taxes on the land,—the germ, perhaps, of the French Revolution,—in
the boudoir of Madame de Pompadour! Bacon knelt
down before composing his great work, and prayed for light
from Heaven. Pope never could compose well without first
declaiming for some time at the top of his voice, and thus
rousing his nervous system to its fullest activity. The life of
Leibnitz was one of reading, writing, and meditation. That
was the secret of his prodigious knowledge. After an attack
of gout, he confined himself to a diet of bread and milk. Often
he slept in a chair, and rarely went to bed till after midnight.
Sometimes he spent months without quitting his seat, where
he slept by night and wrote by day. He had an ulcer in his
right leg, which prevented his walking about even had he
wished to do so.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>CULTURE AND SACRIFICE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The instruction of the world has been carried on by perpetual
sacrifice. A grand army of teachers, authors, artists, schoolmasters,
professors, heads of colleges—have been through ages
carrying on war against ignorance; but no triumphal procession
has been decreed to it, nor spoils of conquered provinces have
come to its coffers; no crown imperial has invested it with pomp
and power. In lonely watch-towers the fires of genius have
burned, but to waste and consume the lamp of life, while they
gave light to the world. It is no answer to say that the victims
of intellectual toil, broken down in health and fortune, have
counted their work a privilege and joy. As well deny the
martyr’s sacrifice because he has joyed in his integrity. And
many of the world’s intellectual benefactors have been martyrs.
Socrates died in prison as a public malefactor; for the healing
wisdom he offered his people, deadly poison was the reward.
Homer had a lot, so obscure at least, that nobody knew his
birthplace; and, indeed, some modern critics are denying that
there ever was any Homer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Plato traveled back and forth from his home in Athens to the
court of the Syracuse tyrant, regarded indeed and feared, but
persecuted and in peril of life; nay, and once sold for a slave.
Cicero shared a worse fate. Dante all his life knew, as he
expressed it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How salt was a stranger’s bread,</div>

<p class='c000'>Copernicus and Galileo found science no more profitable than
Dante found poetry. Shakspeare had a home, but too poorly
endowed to stand long in his name after he left it; the income
upon which he retired was barely two or three hundred pounds
a year, and so little did his contemporaries know or think of
him that the critics hunt in vain for the details of his private
life. The mighty span of his large honors shrinks to an obscure
myth of life in theatres in London or on the banks of the Avon.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>A LITERARY SCREW.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>An English paper says that Sharon Turner, author of the
<cite>History of the Anglo-Saxons</cite>, who received three hundred
pounds a year from Government as a literary pension, wrote
his third volume of his <cite>Sacred History of the World</cite> upon
paper which did not cost him a farthing. The copy consisted
of torn and angular fragments of letters and notes, of covers of
periodicals, gray, drab, or green, written in thick round hand
over a small print; of shreds of curling-paper, unctuous with
pomatum of bear’s grease, and of white wrappers in which his
proofs had been sent from the printers. The paper, sometimes
as thin as a bank-note, was written on both sides, and was so
sodden with ink, plastered on with a pen worn to a stump, that
hours were frequently wasted in discovering on which side of
it certain sentences were written. Men condemned to work on
it saw their dinner vanish in illimitable perspective, and first-rate
hands groaned over it a whole day for tenpence. One poor
fellow assured the writer of that paper that he could not earn
enough upon it to pay his rent, and that he had seven mouths
to fill besides his own. In the hope of mending matters in
some degree, slips of stout white paper were sent frequently
with the proofs; but the good gentleman could not afford to
use them, and they never came back as copy. What an inveterate
miser this old scribbler must have been, notwithstanding
his pension and his copyrights!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DRYDEN AND HIS PUBLISHER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>When Dryden had finished his translation of Virgil, after
some self-deliberation, he sent the MS. to Jacob Tonson, requiring
for it a certain sum, which he mentioned in a note.
Tonson was desirous of possessing the work, but meanly wished
to avail himself of Dryden’s necessities, which at that time
were particularly urgent. He therefore informed the poet that
he could not afford to give the sum demanded. Dryden, in
reply, sent the following lines descriptive of Tonson:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_763'>763</span>With leering look, bull-faced, and freckled fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>With two left legs, with Judas-colored hair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And frowsy pores that taint the ambient air.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When they were delivered to Tonson, he asked if Mr. Dryden
had said any thing more. “Yes,” answered the bearer: “he
said, ‘Tell the dog that he who wrote these lines can write
more like them.’” Jacob immediately sent the money.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ANECDOTE OF WASHINGTON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>During General Washington’s administration, he almost
daily attended his room, adjoining the Senate-chamber, and
often arrived before the Senate organized. On one occasion, but
before his arrival, Gouverneur Morris and some other senators
were standing together, conversing on various topics, and,
among them, the natural but majestic air of General Washington,
when some one observed there was no man living who
could take a liberty with him. The sprightly and bold Morris
remarked, “I will bet a dozen of wine I can do that with impunity.”
The bet was accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, Washington appeared, and commenced an easy
and pleasant conversation with one of the gentlemen, at a little
distance from the others. While thus engaged, Morris, stepping
up, in a jocund manner, familiarly tapped Washington on the
shoulder, and said,—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good morning, old fellow!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The General turned, and merely looked him in the face,
without a word, when Morris, with all his assumed effrontery,
stepped hastily back, in evident discomposure, and said:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gentlemen, you have won the bet. I will never take such
a liberty again!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer obtained this fact from a member of the Senate,
who witnessed the occurrence.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_764'>764</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>ANECDOTE OF LAFAYETTE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Shortly after Lafayette’s second return from America, he was
at Versailles when the king was about to review a division of
troops. Lafayette was invited to join in the review. He was
dressed in the American uniform, and was standing by the side
of the Duc de Condé, when the king, in his tour of conversation
with the officers, came to him, and, after speaking on several
topics, asked him questions about his uniform and the military
costume in the United States. The king’s attention was
attracted by a little medal, which was attached to his coat in
the manner in which the insignia of orders are usually worn in
Europe; and he asked what it was. Lafayette replied that it
was a symbol which it was the custom of the foreign officers in
the American service to wear, and that it bore a device. The
king asked what was the device: to which Lafayette answered
that there was no device common to all, but that each officer
chose such as pleased his fancy. “And what has pleased your
fancy?” inquired the king. “My device,” said the young
general, pointing to his medal, “is a liberty-pole standing on a
broken crown and sceptre.” The king smiled, and, with some
pleasantry about the republican propensities of a French marquis
in American uniform, turned the conversation to another
topic. Condé looked grave, but said nothing.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The name Napoleon, being written in Greek characters, will
form seven different words, by dropping the first letter of each
in succession:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="el" xml:lang="el">Ναπολεων, Ἀπολέον, Πόλεον, Ὁλεον, Λέον, Ἐόν, ὧν.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These words make a complete sentence, meaning, Napoleon,
the destroyer of whole cities, was the lion of his people.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MILTON AND NAPOLEON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Napoleon Bonaparte declared to Sir Colin Campbell, who
had charge of his person at the Isle of Elba, that he was a
great admirer of Milton’s <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>, and that he had read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_765'>765</span>it to some purpose, for that the plan of the battle of Austerlitz
he borrowed from the sixth book of that work, where Satan
brings his artillery to bear upon Michael and his angelic host
with such direful effect:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Training his dev’lish enginery impaled</div>
      <div class='line'>On every side with shadowing squadrons deep</div>
      <div class='line'>To <i>hide the fraud</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This <i>new</i> mode of warfare appeared to Bonaparte so likely to
succeed, if applied to actual use, that he determined upon its
adoption, and succeeded beyond expectation. By reference to
the details of that battle, it will be found to assimilate so completely
with Milton’s imaginary fight as to leave no doubt of
the assertion.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF NAPOLEON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Captain Maitland gives the following description of the person
of Napoleon, as he appeared on board the <i>Bellerophon</i>, in
1815:—</p>

<p class='c000'>He was then a remarkably strong, well-built man, about five
feet seven inches high, his limbs particularly well formed, with
a fine ankle and a very small foot, of which he seemed very
vain, as he always wore, while on board the ship, silk stockings
and shoes. His hands were also small, and had the plumpness
of a woman’s rather than the robustness of a man’s. His eyes
were light gray, his teeth good; and when he smiled, the expression
of his countenance was highly pleasing; when under
the influence of disappointment, however, it assumed a dark
and gloomy cast. His hair was a very dark brown, nearly approaching
to black, and, though a little thin on the top and
front, had not a gray hair amongst it. His complexion was a
very uncommon one, being of a light sallow color, different
from any other I ever met with. From his being corpulent,
he had lost much of his activity.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HIS OPINION OF SUICIDE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the Journal of Dr. Warden, Surgeon of the Northumberland,
the British frigate that conveyed Napoleon to St. Helena,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_766'>766</span>are recorded the following remarkable sentiments of the imperial
prisoner, as expressed to Warden:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In one paper, I am called a <i>liar</i>; in another, a <i>tyrant</i>; in a
third, a <i>monster</i>; and in one of them, which I really did not
expect, I am described as a <i>coward</i>; but it turned out, after all,
that the writer did not accuse me of avoiding danger in the
field of battle, or flying from an enemy, or fearing to face the
menaces of fate and fortune; he did not charge me with wanting
presence of mind in the hurry of battle, and in the suspense
of conflicting armies. No such thing. I wanted courage,
it seems, because I did not coolly take a dose of poison, or throw
myself into the sea, or blow out my brains. The editor most
certainly misunderstands me: I have, at least, too much courage
for that.</p>

<p class='c000'>On another occasion he expressed himself in the following
terms:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Suicide is a crime the most revolting to my feelings, nor does
any reason suggest itself to my understanding by which it can
be justified. It certainly originates in that species of fear
which we denominate <i>poltroonery</i>. For what claim can that
man have to courage who trembles at the frowns of fortune?
True heroism consists in being superior to the ills of life, in
whatever shape they may challenge him to the combat.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DR. FRANKLIN’S WIFE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Franklin, in a sketch of his life and habits, relates the following
anecdote of his frugal and affectionate wife. A wife
could scarcely make a prettier apology for purchasing her first
piece of luxury.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have an English proverb, that says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He that would thrive</div>
      <div class='line'>Must ask his wife.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was lucky for me that I have one as much disposed to industry
and frugality as myself. She assisted me cheerfully in
my business, and in stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing
old linen rags for the paper-makers, &amp;c. We kept no idle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_767'>767</span>servant; our table was plain and simple; our furniture of the
cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was for a long time
bread and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a two-penny earthen
porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will
enter families, and make a progress in spite of principle: being
called one morning to breakfast, I found it in a china bowl,
with a spoon of silver. They had been bought for me without
my knowledge, by my wife, and had cost her the enormous
sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other
excuse or apology to make but that she thought <i>her</i> husband
<i>deserved</i> a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his
neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate or china in
our house, which afterwards, in the course of years, as our
wealth increased, augmented gradually to several hundred
pounds in value.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MAJOR ANDRÉ.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In a satirical poem written by Major André some time prior
to his arrest as a spy, he, curiously enough, alludes to the
means of his own death. A newspaper published soon after
the Revolutionary War gives some extracts from the poem, and
calls it a “remarkable prophecy.” Could the ill-starred poet
and soldier have looked into futurity and seen his own sad
end, he would hardly have indulged in the humor which is indicated
in his poem. The piece was entitled “The Cow-Chase,”
and was suggested by the failure of an expedition undertaken
by Wayne for the purpose of collecting cattle. Great liberties
were taken with the names of the American officers employed
on the occasion,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Harry Lee and his dragoons,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Proctor with his cannon.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But the point of his irony seemed particularly aimed at
Wayne, whose entire baggage, he asserts, was taken along,
comprising</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>His Congress dollars and his prog,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His military speeches,</div>
      <div class='line'>His corn-stalk whiskey for his grog,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Black stockings and blue breeches.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_768'>768</span>The satirist brings his doggerel to a close by observing that
it is necessary to check the current of his satire,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lest the same warrior-drover Wayne</div>

<h3 class='c012'>AN ENGLISH VIEW OF ANDRÉ AND ARNOLD.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Many historians have been inclined to blame Washington for
unnecessary severity in not acceding to the request of the prisoner
(André), that he might be shot instead of hanged. We
cannot agree with them: the ignominious death was decided
upon by Washington—after much and anxious deliberation,
and against his own feelings, which inclined to grant the
prayer—as a strictly preventive punishment; and it had its
effect. The social qualities and the letters of André, although
they are always brought forward in his favor, do not extenuate
but rather aggravate his crime, as they show that, whatever his
moral principles may have been, he had the education of an
English gentleman. If any thing, his memory has been treated
with too great leniency. If monuments are to be erected in
Westminster Abbey to men of such lax morality, it is time for
honesty to hide its head.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conduct of Sir Henry Clinton, in receiving Arnold when
he fled to the English ranks, and giving him a high command,
is only in keeping with his countenance of the plot that cost
André his life. Arnold, who seems to have been a miserable
scoundrel, born to serve as a foil to the virtuous brightness of
George Washington, might have redeemed his character by
giving himself up in place of André, who was entrapped by
Arnold’s cowardice and over-caution; but such a piece of self-sacrifice
never entered his head. A villain himself, he never
believed in the success of the struggle of honest men, and his
conduct after obtaining the protection of Sir Henry Clinton
proves this beyond a doubt. Let him rest with all his British
honors thick upon him.—<cite>English Newspaper.</cite></p>

  <h3 class='c012'>FLAMSTEED, THE ASTRONOMER ROYAL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In the <cite>London Chronicle</cite> for Dec. 3, 1771, is the following
anecdote of Dr. Flamsteed:—</p>

<p class='c000'>He was many years Astronomer Royal at Greenwich Observatory;
a humorist, and of warm passions. Persons of his
profession are often supposed, by the common people, to be
capable of foretelling events. In this persuasion a poor washerwoman
at Greenwich, who had been robbed at night of a
large parcel of linen, to her almost ruin, if forced to pay for it,
came to him, and with great anxiety earnestly requested him to
use his art, to let her know where her things were, and who had
robbed her. The Doctor happened to be in the humor to joke:
he bid her stay: he would see what he could do; perhaps he
might let her know where she could find them; but who the
persons were, he would not undertake; as she could have no
positive proof to convict them, it would be useless. He then set
about drawing circles, squares, &amp;c., to amuse her; and after
some time told her if she would go into a particular field, that
in such a part of it, in a dry ditch, she would find them all
tumbled up in a sheet. The woman went, and found them;
came with great haste and joy to thank the Doctor, and offered
him half-a-crown as a token of gratitude, being as much as she
could afford. The Doctor, surprised himself, told her: “Good
woman, I am heartily glad you have found your linen; but I
assure you I knew nothing of it, and intended only to joke
with you, and then to have read you a lecture on the folly
of applying to any person to know events not in human power
to tell. But I see the devil has a mind that I should deal
with him: I am determined I will not. Never come or send
any one to me any more, on such occasions; for I will never
attempt such an affair again whilst I live.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LORD NELSON’S SANG-FROID.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Jack was what they called loblolly boy on board the <i>Victory</i>.
It was his duty to do anything and everything that was required—from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_770'>770</span>sweeping and washing the deck, and saying amen to
the chaplain, down to cleaning the guns, and helping the doctor
to make pills and plasters, and mix medicines. Four days
before the battle that was so glorious to England, but so fatal
to its greatest hero, Jack was ordered by the doctor to fetch a
bottle that was standing in a particular place. Jack ran off,
post-haste, to the spot, where he found what appeared to be an
empty bottle. Curiosity was uppermost; “What,” thought
Jack, “can there be about this empty bottle?” He examined it
carefully, but could not comprehend the mystery, so he thought
that he would call in the aid of a candle to throw light on the
subject. The bottle contained <i>ether</i>, and the result of the
examination was that the vapor ignited, and the flames extended
to some of the sails, and also to a part of the ship. There was
a general confusion—running with buckets and what-not—and,
to make matters worse, the fire was rapidly extending to the
powder-magazine. During the hubbub, Lord Nelson was in the
chief cabin writing dispatches. His lordship heard the noise—he
couldn’t do otherwise—and so, in a loud voice, he called
out, “What’s all that infernal noise about?” The boatswain
answered, “My Lord, the loblolly boy’s set fire to an empty
bottle, and it’s set fire to the ship.” “Oh!” said Nelson, “that’s
all, is it? I thought the enemy had boarded us and taken us all
prisoners—you and loblolly must put it out, and take care
we’re not blown up! but pray make as little noise about it as
you can, or I can’t go on with my dispatches,” and with these
words Nelson went to his desk, and continued his writing with
the greatest coolness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crabb Robinson, in his <cite>Diary</cite>, speaking of Gœthe as the

<div class='c039'><span class='sc'>R. Montgomery.</span></div>

<p class='c000'>Heine sketches the following unique portrait of Luther:—</p>

<p class='c000'>He was at once a mystic dreamer and a man of action. His
thoughts had not only wings, they had hands likewise. He
spoke, and, rare thing, he also acted; he was at once the
tongue and the sword of his age. At the same time he was a
cold scholastic, a chopper of words, and an exalted prophet
drunk with the word of God. When he had passed painfully
through the day, wearing out his soul in dogmatical instructions,
night come, he would take his flute, and, contemplating
the stars, melt in melodies and pious thoughts. The same man
who could abuse his adversaries like a fish-fag knew also how
to use soft and tender language, like an amorous virgin. He
was sometimes savage and impetuous as the hurricane that
roots up oaks, then gentle and murmuring as the zephyr that
lightly caresses the violets. He was full of the holy fear of
God, ready for every sacrifice in honor of the Holy Spirit; he
knew how to vault into the purest regions of the celestial
kingdom; and yet he perfectly knew the magnificence of this
earth: he could appreciate it, and from his mouth fell the
famous proverb:—</p>

<p class='c000'>In an article on John de Wycliffe, in the <cite>North British Review</cite>,
is the following paragraph:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Abundant as is our historical literature, and fond as our ablest
writers have recently become of attempting careful and vivid
renderings of the physiognomies of important historical personages,
we are still without a set of thoroughly good portraits
of the modern religious reformers of different nations, painted,
as they might be, in series, so that the features of each may be
compared with those of all the rest. Wycliffe, Huss, Savonarola,
Luther, Zwingle, Calvin, Knox, and Cranmer,—all men
coming under the same general designation,—all heroes of the
same general movement; and yet what a contrast of physiognomies!
Pre-eminent in the series will ever be Luther,
the man of biggest frame and largest heart; the man of richest
and most original genius; the great, soft, furious, musical,
pliant, sociable, kiss-you, knock-you-down German. None of
them all had such a face; none of them all said such things;
of none of them all can you have such anecdotes, such a collection
of <i>ana</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Luther, says another writer, speaking of his fondness for
music, was not solely nor chiefly a theologian, or he had been
no true reformer. As the cloister had not been able to bound
his sympathies, so the controversial theatre could not circumscribe
his honest ambition. He in whom “the Italian head
was joined to the German body” would not only free the souls
of men, but win the hearts of women and little children.
Much had he to feel proud of during his busy life. It was no
light thing to have waged successful combat with the most
powerful hierarchy that the world had ever seen, or to have
held in his hands the destinies of Europe. But dearer to his
kind heart was the sound of his own verses sung to his own
melodies, which rose from street and market-place, from highway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_773'>773</span>and byway, chanted by laborers going to their daily work,
during their hours of toil, and as they returned home at even-tide.
How would it have gladdened his heart to have heard
these same hymns, two hundred years later, sung by the miners
of Cornwall and Gloucestershire!</p>

<p class='c000'>“I always loved music,” said he: “whoso has skill in this
art is of a good temperament, fitted for all things.” Many
times he exemplified this power in his own person. When sore
perplexed and in danger of life, he would drive away all gloomy
thoughts by the magic of his own melodies. On that sad
journey to Worms, when friends crowded round him and
sought to change his purpose, warning him, with many tears,
of the certain death that awaited him,—on the morning of
that memorable 16th of April, when the towers of the ancient
city appeared in sight,—the true-hearted man, rising in his
chariot, broke forth with the words and music of that Marseillaise
of the Reformation, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott</span></cite>, which
he had improvised two days before at Oppenheim,—the same
stirring hymn that Gustavus Adolphus and the whole Swedish
army sang a century later, on the morning of the battle of
Lutzen:—</p>

<h3 class='c012'>QUEEN ELIZABETH.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Queen Bess is thus described in Sir John Hayward’s
Annals:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Shee was a lady upon whom nature had bestowed, and well
placed, many of her fayrest favours; of stature meane, slender,
straight, and amiably composed; of such state in her carriage,
as every motion of her seemed to beare majesty; her haire was
inclined to pale yellow, her foreheade large and faire, and
seeming seat for princely grace; her eyes lively and sweete,
but short-sighted; her nose somewhat rising in the middest.
The whole compasse of her countenance somewhat long, but
yet of admirable beauty; not so much in that which is termed
the flower of youth, as in a most delightful compositione of
majesty and modesty in equall mixture.... Her vertues
were such as might suffice to make an Ethiopian beautifull,
which, the more man knows and understands, the more he
shall love and admire. Shee was of divine witt, as well for
depth of judgment, as for quick conceite and speedy expeditione;
of eloquence as sweete in the utterance, as ready and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_775'>775</span>easy to come to the utterance; of wonderful knowledge, both
in learning and affayres; skilfull not only in Latine and
Greeke, but alsoe in divers foraigne languages.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Paul Heintzner’s Travels</cite>, 1598, is the following description:—</p>

<p class='c000'>She was said to be fifty-five years old. Her face was rather
long, white, and somewhat wrinkled; her eyes small, black,
and gracious; her nose somewhat bent; her lips compressed;
her teeth black (from eating too much sugar). She had earrings
of pearls, red hair (but artificial), and wore a small crown.
Her breast was uncovered (as is the case with all unmarried
ladies in England), and round her neck was a chain with precious
gems. Her hands were graceful, her fingers long. She
was of middle size, but stepped on majestically. She was gracious
and kind in her address. The dress she wore was of
white silk, with pearls as large as beans. Her cloak was of
black silk, with silver lace, and a long train was carried by a
marchioness. She spoke English, French, and Italian; but she
knew also Greek and Latin, and understood Spanish, Scotch,
and Dutch. Wherever she turned her eyes, people fell on their
knees. When she came to the door of the chapel, books were
handed to her, and the people called out, “God save the Queen
Elizabeth!” whereupon the Queen answered, “I thanke you,
myn good peuple.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the spirited repartees and impromptus of the queen
which have descended to our time is her ingenious evasion of
a direct answer to a theological question respecting the sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper. On being asked by a Popish
priest whether she allowed the <i>real presence</i>, she replied,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Christ was the word that spake it:</div>
      <div class='line'>He took the bread and brake it;</div>
      <div class='line'>And what that word did make it,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I believe and take it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In an old folio copy of the <cite>Arcadia</cite>, preserved at Wilton,
have been found two interesting relics,—a lock of Queen
Elizabeth’s hair, and some lines in the handwriting of Sir
Philip Sidney. The hair was given by the queen to her young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_776'>776</span>hero, who complimented her in return as follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her inward worth all outward worth transcends;</div>
      <div class='line'>Envy her merits with regret commends;</div>
      <div class='line'>Like sparkling gems her virtues draw the light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in her conduct she is always bright.</div>
      <div class='line'>When she imparts her thoughts, her words have force,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sense and wisdom flow in sweet discourse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The date of this exchange was 1583, when the queen was
forty and the knight twenty-nine. Elizabeth’s hair is very
fine, soft, and silky, with the undulation of water; its color, a
fair auburn or golden brown, without a tinge of red, as her
detractors assert. In every country under the sun, such hair
would be pronounced beautiful.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SHAKSPEARE’S ORTHODOXY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The numerous biographers of the immortal bard have said
little or nothing of his religious character, leaving the inference
that he was indifferent to religion and careless as to
the future. They seem to forget such passages as his beautiful
reference to Palestine in <cite>Henry IV.</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>

      <div class='line in20'>Those holy fields,</div>
      <div class='line'>Over whose acres walked those blessed feet</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, fourteen hundred years ago, were nailed,</div>
      <div class='line'>For our advantage, on the bitter cross.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Shakspeare’s will, written two months before his death, (April,
1616,) is remarkable for its evangelical character. He says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“First, I commend my soul into the hands of God, my
Creator, hoping, and assuredly believing, through the merits
of Jesus Christ, my Saviour, to be made partaker of life everlasting;
and my body to the earth whereof it is made.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor should we overlook the bond of Christian sympathy
with his parish minister, Rev. Richard Byfield, whose church
he constantly attended during his retirement at Stratford.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OLIVER CROMWELL.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The subjoined sketch of the person and character of the
great Protector is from a letter of John Maidstone to Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_777'>777</span>Winthrop, of Connecticut, written soon after Cromwell’s
death:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Before I pass further, pardon me in troubling you with the
character of his person, which, by reason of my nearness to
him, I had opportunity well to observe. His body was well
compact and strong; his stature under six feet (I believe
about two inches); his head so shaped as you might see it a
storehouse and shop, both a vast treasury of natural parts.
His temper exceeding fiery, as I have known; but the flame of
it kept down for the most part, or soon allayed with those moral
endowments he had. He was naturally compassionate towards
objects in distress, even to an effeminate measure, though
God had made him a heart wherein was left little room for
any fear but what was due to himself, of which there was a
large proportion; yet did he excel in tenderness towards sufferers.
A larger soul, I think, hath seldom dwelt in a house
of clay than his was. I do believe, if his story were impartially
transmitted and the unprejudiced world well possessed
with it, it would add him to her nine worthies and make that
number a decemviri. He lived and died in comfortable communion
with his seed, as judicious persons near him well observed.
He was that Mordecai that sought the welfare of his people,
and spake peace to his seed; yet were his temptations such as
it appeared frequently that he that hath grace enough for
many men may have too little for himself; the treasure he had
being but in an earthen vessel, and that equally defiled with
original sin as any other man’s nature is.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following newspaper notices in relation to Cromwell’s
head are interesting:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The curious head of Cromwell, which Sir Joshua Reynolds
has had the good fortune to procure, is to be shown to his majesty.
How much would Charles the First have valued the
man that would have brought him Cromwell’s head!—September,
1786.</p>

<p class='c000'>The real embalmed head of the powerful and renowned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_778'>778</span>usurper, Oliver Cromwell, styled Protector of the Commonwealth
of England, Scotland, and Ireland; with the original dyes
for the medals struck in honor of his victory at Dunbar, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., are now exhibiting at No. 5 in Mead Court, Old Bond
Street (where the Rattlesnake was shown last year). A genuine
narrative relating to the acquisition, concealment, and preservation
of these articles to be had at the place of exhibition.—<cite>Morning
Chronicle</cite>, March 18, 1799.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cromwell died at Hampton Court in 1658, giving the
strongest evidence of his earnest religious convictions and of
his sincerity as a Christian. After an imposing funeral pageant,
the body having been embalmed, he was buried in
Westminster. On the restoration of the Stuarts he was taken
up and hung in Tyburn. Afterwards his head was cut off, a
pike driven up through the neck and skull, and exposed on
Westminster Hall. It remained there a long while, until, by
some violence, the pike was broken and the head thrown down.
It was picked up by a soldier and concealed, and afterwards conveyed
to some friend, who kept it carefully for years. Through
a succession of families, which can easily be traced, it has come
into the possession of the daughter of Hon. Mr. Wilkinson,
ex-member of Parliament from Buckingham and Bromley.</p>

<p class='c000'>The head is almost entire. The flesh is black and sunken,
but the features are nearly perfect, and the hair still remains.
Even the large wart over one of the eyes—a distinctive mark
on his face—is yet perfectly visible. The pike which was
thrust through the neck may still be seen, the upper part of iron,
nearly rusted off, and the lower or wooden portion in splinters,
showing that it was broken by some act of violence. It is
known historically that Cromwell was embalmed; and no person
thus cared for was ever publicly gibbeted except this illustrious
man. It is a curious keepsake for a lady; but it is carefully
preserved under lock and key in a box of great antiquity,
wrapped in a number of costly envelopes. And when it is raised
from its hiding-place and held in one’s hand, what a world of
thought is suggested!</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>POPE’S SKULL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>William Howitt says that, by one of those acts which neither
science nor curiosity can excuse, the skull of Pope is now in
the private collection of a phrenologist. The manner in which
it was obtained is said to have been this:—On some occasion
of alteration in the church, or burial of some one in the same
spot, the coffin of Pope was disinterred, and opened to see the
state of the remains. By a bribe to the sexton of the time,
possession of the skull was obtained for the night, and another
skull was returned instead of it. Fifty pounds were paid to
manage and carry through this transaction. Be that as it may,
the skull of Pope figures in a private museum.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WICKLIFFE’S ASHES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Council of Constance raised from the grave the bones
of the immortal Wickliffe forty years after their interment,
burned them to ashes, and threw them into a neighboring
brook. “This brook,” says Fuller, “conveyed his ashes into
Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn into the narrow seas, they into
the main ocean; and thus the ashes of Wickliffe are the emblem
of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the world
over.” “So,” says Foxe, “was he resolved into three elements,
earth, fire, and water, thinking thereby utterly to extinguish
both the name and doctrine of Wickliffe forever. But as there
is no counsel against the Lord, so there is no keeping down of
verity. It will spring and come out of dust and ashes, as appeared
right well in this man; for, though they digged up his
body, burnt his bones, and drowned his ashes, yet the word of
God and truth of his doctrines, with the fruit and success
thereof, they could not burn. They to this day remain.”</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>Cardan, and Burton, the author of the <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>,
who were famous for astrological skill, both suffered a
voluntary death merely to verify their own predictions.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_780'>780</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>TALLEYRANDIANA.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A banker, anxious about the rise or fall of stocks, came once
to Talleyrand for information respecting the truth of a rumor
that George III. had suddenly died, when the statesman
replied in a confidential tone: “I shall be delighted, if the
information I have to give be of any use to you.” The banker
was enchanted at the prospect of obtaining authentic intelligence
from so high a source; and Talleyrand, with a mysterious
air, continued: “Some say the King of England is dead;
others, that he is not dead: for my own part, I believe neither
the one nor the other. I tell you this in confidence, but do not
commit me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>During Talleyrand’s administration, when the seals of private
letters were not very safe, the Spanish Ambassador complained,
with an expressive look, to that Minister, that one of his despatches
had been opened. “Oh!” returned the statesman, after
listening with profound attention, “I shall wager I can guess how
the thing happened. I am convinced your despatch was opened
by some one who desired to know what was inside.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Louis XVIII., at the Restoration, praised the subtile
diplomatist for his talents and influence, he disclaimed the compliment,
but added, what might serve both as a hint and a
threat: “There is, however, some inexplicable thing about me,
that prevents any government from prospering that attempts to
set me aside.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Pope excommunicated his apostate Abbé, that unworthy
son of the church wrote to a friend, saying: “Come
and comfort me: come and sup with me. Everybody is going
to refuse me fire and water; we shall therefore have nothing
this evening but iced meats, and drink nothing but wine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Abbé Dupanloup told him, during his last hour,
that the Archbishop of Paris had said he would willingly die
for him, the dying statesman said, with his expiring breath:
“He might make a better use of his life.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_781'>781</span>He proposed that the Duchess de Berri should be threatened
for all her strange conspicuous freaks, thus: “Madame, there is
no hope for you, you will be tried, condemned, and pardoned!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Speaking of a well-known lady on one occasion, he said emphatically:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“She is insufferable.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, as if relenting, he added:</p>

<p class='c018'>“But that is her only fault.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Madame de Stael cordially hated him, and in her story of
<cite>Delphine</cite> was supposed to have painted herself in the person
of her heroine, and Talleyrand in that of a garrulous old
woman. On their first meeting, the wit pleasantly remarked,
“They tell me that we are both of us in your novel, in the disguise
of women.”</p>

<p class='c000'>While making a few days’ tour in England, he wrote this
note to a gentleman connected with the Treasury:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“My dear Sir,</div>

<div class='c039'>“<span class='sc'>Talleyrand</span>.”</div>

<h3 class='c012'>PORSON.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A favorite diversion of Porson, when among a party of literary
men, was to quote a few lines of poetry, and ask if any of the
company could tell where they came from. He frequently
quoted the following lines without finding any one able to name
the author:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For laws that are inanimate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feel no sense of love or hate,</div>
      <div class='line'>That have no passion of their own,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or pity to be wrought upon,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are only proper to inflict</div>
      <div class='line'>Revenge on criminals as strict:</div>
      <div class='line'>But to have power to forgive</div>
      <div class='line'>Is empire and prerogative;</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’tis in crowns a nobler gem</div>
      <div class='line'>To grant a pardon than condemn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_782'>782</span>The lines remind the Shakspeare student of a similar verse in
<cite>Measure for Measure</cite>, (Act III, Sc. 2.):—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He that the sword of state would bear,</div>

      <div class='line'>Grace to stand, and virtue go, &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The company generally guessed every likely author but the
right one. When conjecture was exhausted, Porson would
satisfy curiosity by telling them the lines were in Butler’s
<cite>Hudibras</cite>, and would be found in <cite>The Heroic Epistle of
Hudibras to his Lady</cite>, which few people ever did read, and no
one now thinks of reading.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST BLOOD SHED IN OUR REVOLUTION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The “First Blood of the Revolution” is commonly supposed
to have been shed at Lexington, April 19, 1775; but Westminster,
Vt., files a prior claim in favor of one William French,
who it is asserted was killed on the night of March 13, 1775,
at the King’s court-house, in what is now Westminster. At
that time Vermont was a part of New York, and the King’s
court officers, together with a body of troops, were sent on to
Westminster to hold the usual session of the court. The people,
however, were exasperated, and assembled in the court-house
to resist. A little before midnight the troops of George the
Third advanced and fired indiscriminately upon the crowd, instantly
killing William French, whose head was pierced by a
musket ball. He was buried in the churchyard, and a stone
erected to his memory, with this quaint inscription:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“In Memory of William French, Who Was Shot at Westminster March
ye 12th, 1775, by the hand of the Cruel Ministerial tools of Georg ye 3rd
at the Courthouse at 11 o’clock at Night in the 22d year of his age.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>THE “TEA-PARTY” AND THE “TEA-BURNING.”</h3>

<p class='c013'>The world has rung with the story of the “Boston tea-party,”
how in the darkness of night certain men disguised as
Indians threw overboard the cargo which bore the obnoxious
duty, and kept their secret so well that even their own families
were not trusted with it. It was a resolute and patriotic act,
and answered its purpose. But why all the darkness, the disguise
and mystery? Because the number of those who opposed
the act, either from loyalty to Great Britain, from timidity, or
from pecuniary interest in the cargo, was so great, that only by
such means could the deed be done and the doers of it escape
punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>How does this compare with the “tea-burning” in Annapolis
in the same year? Here the course to be taken was publicly
and calmly discussed in open assembly; the resolution arrived
at was openly announced, and carried out in the face of day,
the owner of the vessel himself applying the torch. This was
the Maryland way of doing the thing; and it may well be
asked whether the calm judicial dignity of the procedure, the
unanimity of sentiment, the absence alike of passion and of
concealment, are not far worthier of commemoration and admiration
than the act of men who, even for a patriotic purpose,
had to assume the garb of conspirators and do a deed of
darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The local historians thus tell the story:—</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 14th of October, the brig Peggy Stewart arrived at
Annapolis, having in its cargo a few packages of tea. The
duty was paid by the owner of the vessel. The people were
outraged at the attempt to fix upon them the badge of servitude,
by the payment of the tax.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_784'>784</span>A meeting was held, at which it was determined that the
tea should not be landed. The owner, fearing further trouble,
proposed to destroy the tea. But that was not sufficient punishment.
The offence was a grave one, for had this attempt
succeeded, it would have been followed by others more aggressive,
and thus the very principle which was contended for
would have been overthrown in the end. It was the head of
the ugly beast that was thrust in the door, and it must not
only be <i>put</i> out, but <i>driven</i> out by blows, lest growing bold,
it should push its whole body in.</p>

<p class='c000'>After much discussion it was proposed to burn the vessel.
The meeting did not consent to this, but many expressed their
determination to raise a force to accomplish the brig’s destruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Acting under the advice of Mr. Carroll of Carrollton, the
owner, seeing that the loss of his property was certain, and willing
to repair his good name, even by that loss, proposed to destroy
the vessel with his own hands. In the presence of the
assembled multitude he set fire to it, with the tea on board,—expiating
his offence by the destruction of his property.</p>

<p class='c000'>The striking features of this transaction were not only the
boldness with which it was executed, but the deliberation and
utter carelessness of concealment in all the measures leading to
its accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not until the 28th of November that the Dartmouth
arrived in Boston harbor, and not until the 16th of December
that protracted discussion ended in the overthrow of its cargo.
The tea-ship sent to South Carolina arrived December 2d, and
the tea-ship to Philadelphia, December 25th. The cargo of
the former perished in storage; that of the latter was sent
back.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE UNITED STATES NAVY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A South Carolina correspondent of the <cite>American Historical
Record</cite> writes as follows concerning the inception of the
Navy:—</p>

<p class='c000'>A few years ago, while looking over a volume of manuscript
<span class='pageno' id='Page_785'>785</span>letters in the Charleston (South Carolina) Library, I found a
leaf of coarse foolscap, with the following endorsement:—</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ORIGIN OF THE NAVY.</h4>

<p class='c013'>At a caucus in 1794, consisting of Izard, Morris, and Ellsworth
of the Senate, Ames, Sedgwick, Smith, Dayton, &amp;c. of
the Representatives, and of Secretaries Hamilton and Knox, to
form a plan for a national navy, Smith began the figuring as
Secretary of the meeting. Hamilton then took the pen, and
instead of minuting the proceedings, he amused himself by
making a variety of flourishes during the discussion. In consequence
of the plan adopted at this meeting, a bill was reported
for building six frigates, which formed the foundation or origin
of the American Navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “figuring” on the top of the page consists of five lines,
and is as follows:—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c010'>First cost of a frigate, 44 guns, of 1,300 tons, and     provision for six months</td>
    <td class='c011'>$150,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c010'>350 men</td>
    <td class='c011'>51,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c010'>Provision for six months</td>
    <td class='c011'>11,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c010'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c011'><hr /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c024'>Total</td>
    <td class='c011'>$212,000</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>Then follows an estimate of the annual cost of such a vessel.
The rest of the page below these estimates is occupied by
bold flourishes, which seem, if they mean anything, to imitate
a drawing of a peacock’s tail “in its pride.” Similar scratching,
but to a less extent is on the other side of the page.</p>

<hr class='c022' />

<p class='c000'>The only letter addressed to Shakspeare, which is undoubtedly
genuine, is that now in the museum at Stratford, from
Richard Quinn, the actor, asking for a loan of £20. This letter
is endorsed: “To my lovinge good ffriend and countreyman,
Mr. William Shackespere deliver Thees.” If the writer spelled
names no better than other words, this affords little aid to the
solution of the perplexing question, for notwithstanding the
outrageous fashion in which our forefathers spelled English, he
is considerably ahead of his age in this respect.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AN AMERICAN MONARCHY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>After the downfall of Napoleon I., in 1815, several young
Americans who subsequently earned high position as writers
and statesmen, among them Irving, Everett, Ticknor, Legaré,
and Preston, (afterward Senator from South Carolina,) went to
Europe for the benefit of foreign travel. While abroad, they
took an opportunity to pay a visit to Sir Walter Scott, and Mr.
Preston relates that during the evening, in the course of conversation,
Sir Walter gave an account of a curious discovery he
had made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not long after it had been divulged who was the author of
the “Waverley Novels,” Scott was the Regent’s (afterward
George the Fourth) guest in the royal palace, where, one day,
the latter ordered the key of a certain room to be given to the
great writer, saying that it opened the door of the Stuart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_787'>787</span>Chamber, where all the papers concerning the Stuarts and
their pretenders were kept. George gave Scott full permission
to rummage among all these records, and to use what he liked
for his works. “I depend on your discretion,” he said, and
Scott went. He spent several days in this curious chamber, and,
so he told Preston, one day stumbled upon what seemed to him
a remarkable paper. It consisted of a call and petition, by
Scottish in America, chiefly, however, by the Gaelic Scottish
who had a settlement—“saddle-bagging” as it is sometimes
expressed in the West—in North Carolina, addressed to the
Pretender (Prince Charles Edward, grandson of James the
Second), as he was then called, to come to America and assume
the crown of this realm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question whether this country had not best be turned
into a monarchy was seriously and very naturally mooted, in
the earliest days of our national existence, but until this singular
revelation was made, it was not known that such a positive
offer, a very strange one, to say the least, had been made.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following description of the significance of the different
parts of our national flag was written by a member of the committee
appointed by the Continental Congress to design a flag
for the young Republic:—</p>

<p class='c018'>The stars of the new flag represent the new constellation of States rising
in the West. The idea was taken from the constellation of Lyra, which in
the land of Orpheus signifies harmony. The blue in the field was taken
from the edges of the Covenanter’s banner, in Scotland, significant of the
league-covenant of the United Colonies against oppression, incidentally
involving the virtues of vigilance, perseverance and justice. The stars
were disposed in a circle symbolizing the perpetuity of the Union; the
ring, like the serpent of the Egyptians, signifying eternity. The thirteen
stripes showed with the stars, the number of the United Colonies, and
denoted the subordination of the States to the Union, as well as equality
among themselves. The whole was the blending of the various flags of
the army and the white ones of the floating batteries. The red color,
which in Roman days was the signal of defiance, denoted daring; and the
white purity.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_788'>788</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>THE FRENCH TRICOLOR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The French tricolor, so far from being a revolutionary flag,
is more ancient than the white flag, and was, in fact, the flag of
the House of Bourbon. Clovis, when he marched through
Tours to fight the Visigoths, adopted as his banner the scope
of St. Martin, which was blue, and thus blue was, so to speak,
the first French color. The oriflamme, which was the particular
flag of the Abbey of St. Denis, and was red, became to a certain
extent the national flag, when St. Denis came under the protection
of the kings of France, the kings still preserving their
blue flag studded with golden <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs de lis</span></i>. The white flag
(which was also the banner of Joan of Arc) has in all countries,
and through all times, been the sign of authority. And when
Louis XIV. destroyed the functions of the colonels-general of
the different corps that bore the white standard, the color
became the emblem of Royal authority. Nevertheless, it is
useless to dispute the fact that the tricolor took its rise as the
badge of the National Guard at the French Revolution, and
that it will be as difficult to separate it from the idea of revolution
as to separate the white flag from the idea of legitimacy.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE POLITICAL GAMUT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In 1815 the French newspapers announced the departure of
Bonaparte from Elba, his progress through France, and his entry;
into Paris, in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c000'>March 9. The Anthropophagus has quitted his den.—March 10.
The Corsican Ogre has landed at Cape Juan.—March
11. The Tiger has arrived at Gap.—March 12. The
Monster slept at Grenoble.—March 13. The Tyrant has passed
through Lyons.—March 14. The Usurper is directing his steps
towards Dijon, but the brave and loyal Burgundians have risen
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, and surrounded him on all sides.—March 18. Bonaparte
is only sixty leagues from the capital; he has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_789'>789</span>fortunate enough to escape the hands of his pursuers.—March
19. Bonaparte is advancing with rapid steps, but he will never
enter Paris.—March 20. Napoleon will, to-morrow, be under
our ramparts.—March 21. The Emperor is at Fontainebleau.—March
22. His Imperial and Royal Majesty yesterday evening
arrived at the Tuileries, amidst the joyful acclamations of his
devoted and faithful subjects.
5
The <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Débats</span></cite>, in reference to the escape from Elba,
spoke of Napoleon on the 9th of March, as “the <cite>Poltroon of
1814</cite>.” On the 15th it said to him, “<i>Scourge of generations
thou shall reign no more!</i>” On the 16th he is “<i>a Robespierre
on horseback</i>”; on the 19th, “<i>the adventurer from Corsica</i>”; but
on the 21st, we are gravely told that “<i>the</i> <span class='fss'>EMPEROR</span> <i>has pursued
his triumphal course, having found no other enemies than
the miserable libels which were vainly scattered on his path to
impede his progress</i>.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FLIGHT OF EUGENIE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The following particulars of the flight of the Empress of
France from Paris, in consequence of the subversion of the
Napoleonic dynasty by the capitulation of Sedan, were furnished
by the late Bishop McIlvaine, of Ohio, who obtained
them from one who aided the flight of Eugenie, and are therefore
stamped with the essentials of authenticity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The safety of the Empress had been assured to her by General
Trochu, who had solemnly promised to inform her of the
approach of danger. For some unexplained reasons he failed
to do so, and when on Sunday the mob began to assemble about
the Tuileries, three of her friends, Prince Metternich, the Spanish
Ambassador and M. Lesseps, formed a plan for her escape, and
went to her rescue. M. Lesseps stood outside and harangued
the mob for the purpose of detaining them, while the two other
gentlemen went in search of the Empress. They found her
partaking of a very frugal lunch with one of her ladies, and
her fears could not be aroused. Seeing it impossible to persuade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_790'>790</span>her, the two gentlemen used force to remove her. At this she
consented to make a slight preparation, and without at all
changing her dress, (for the mob had already entered the
Palace), catching up a small leathern reticule, she put into it
two pocket-handkerchiefs, and two books, the New Testament
and a prayer-book. On her head she put a riding hat, and then
by that time thoroughly aroused, she fled through the Palace,
through long corridors, up and down flights of stairs, through
chamber and <i>salon</i>, a long distance before they came down to the
Rue Rivoli, on which side of the Palace the mob had not collected.
Here a cab awaited her. She, with the lady in attendance,
was put into it. “Now,” said the friends, “we must leave
you; too well-known, our attendance would bring destruction
upon you! Make good speed!” Yes, good speed, for she heard
the cries of the furious mob, and as she was entering the cab a
little boy exclaimed, “There is the Empress,” and she thought
all was lost; but it proved that there was no one there to take
notice, and so the two ladies drove off. Soon they came into
the midst of the excited crowd, and the lady accompanying her
questioned on this side and the other the meaning of it all, and
appeared to be lost in wonder at the proceedings, while the
Empress sank back out of sight in the carriage. They had a
long ride out beyond the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs Élysées</span> to the quieter parts
of the city, when they alighted, dismissed the cab, to avoid
giving any clew in case of pursuit, and walked some distance.
Where should she go? To whom flee? What friend trust?
There was but one to whom she would venture, and that one
an American gentlemen of some note, who, with his wife, had
long been a friend of both Emperor and Empress. So they took
another cab for the house of this gentleman (whom we will
call Mr. W——), arriving there to find him away from home,
and his wife absent for the summer at a small seaport on the
coast. The servant under these circumstances was extremely
ungracious, and quite refused to admit these strange ladies, and
when at last, upon their insisting, they were admitted to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_791'>791</span>house, she was unwilling to show them into an apartment
suitable for them, and it was not without some difficulty that
they were allowed to wait in the library for the owner’s return.
When at last he returned and entered the room, judge of his
surprise at the sight of the Empress. “You must get me immediately
out of France,—this very night,” exclaimed the Empress
the moment she saw him. Out of France that very
night? He told her it was impossible. He was expecting a
party of friends to dinner, but would plead sudden business and
excuse himself, and make preparations as quickly as possible
for her flight; but, in the meantime, she must be quiet and rest.
This she was prevailed upon to do, and, supplying herself from
Mrs. W——’s wardrobe, retired for the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dinner party, receiving the excuses of the host, and
overcome with a sense of mystery, soon withdrew in spite of
the cordial message and wishes of the gentleman that they would
make themselves merry in his absence. At four o’clock in the
morning a carriage stood at the door, into which Mr. W——
put the two ladies, and, driving himself, they set off on their
way out of France, pursuing quiet streets, confining their course
to unfrequented roads and lanes of the country, and avoiding
the more public highways, until the horses were worn out. They
were then near a little village; and the question arose how to
get a carriage brought to them, and explain why they could not
go to it. Mr. W—— went to the inn and, having found a
private carriage which was waiting over there, agreed with the
servant to come out a mile or so and carry his party, Mr.
W——’s two sisters—one of whom was very lame indeed,
and could not walk a step—some miles on, till they should
come to a railway. This done and the lame lady with much
difficulty put into the carriage by her “brother” and “sister,”
they proceeded for a distance until they came to a railway,
where they left the carriage to break up the clew, and rode a
short distance in the rail-car without attracting attention. Then
they took another carriage, riding in roundabout ways, until at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_792'>792</span>the end of two days they reached the little seaport where Mrs.
W—— was spending the summer. How must Mr. W——
conduct the ladies into the presence of his wife without being
observed by every one? After some reconnoitring, this was
successfully accomplished, and throwing her arms around the
neck of Mrs. W——, Eugenie exclaimed: “You and your
husband are the only friends left to me in the world.” She,
with the lady who accompanied her, remained in the room
of Mrs. W——, lest some one should see and recognize her.
No servant could be allowed to enter the room. Mrs. W——
brought food to the two ladies and served the Empress in
everything, who expostulated at the inconvenience she was
causing her friend, and insisted upon waiting upon herself,
her behavior being of such a sweet character as still more to
endear her to her friends, who were risking nearly all they possessed
in her cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their plan was now to get her across the Channel to the Isle
of Wight, and thence to England. There were but two conveyances
in the harbor—both private yachts—and only one able
to get out to sea. The owner of that one flatly refused to take
the ladies over, but at last, after the identity of the ladies had
been made known and much persuasion used, he consented, and
Mr. W—— and the two ladies, with the reticule containing
two pocket-handkerchiefs, set out the day after their arrival
in the little seaport town on their voyage to England.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is a journey usually made in a few hours; but a terrible
storm arising, it was prolonged to twenty-seven. The same
night and in the same waters the ever-memorable vessel the
<i>Captain</i> went down. But although the gentleman in command
lost all control of himself and ship, they weathered the storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this time Eugenie showed the most remarkable self-possession,
and evidently looked upon death as a relief from her
woes. But this was not to be, and after a passage fraught with
the most imminent danger, she was landed on the Isle of Wight,
to find on English ground that asylum which had been sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_793'>793</span>by so many fugitives before her. And to add to her relief, her
son, of whose whereabouts she knew nothing, was found to be
in Hastings, not far from her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such is the true story of Eugenie’s escape from Paris and
France. What a sad, sad tale of fallen greatness! How much
must she have suffered in those few days! the fury of a
Paris mob in her ears; the fear of pursuit at her back; how
often did she start, and give herself up for lost! What
threatening meaning did many an accidental phrase assume!
No wonder her courage sustained the fearful storm; the thunder
and lightning, the waters, however dark and cold and deep,
would be far more merciful than that dreadful mob that called
out her name, the mob that had shown no pity to the little
child or tender woman, and derided with the bitterest insults
the fond Marie Antoinette at the guillotine. Oh, France!
when we remember those days of terror, can we wonder at this
retribution?</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE EMPIRE IS PEACE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>This memorable utterance was originally made at Toulouse
in the autumn of 1852, while Louis Napoleon was feeling the
public pulse in the vineyards of Southern France, preparatory
to re-establishing the imperial <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i>. At the close of a
splendid banquet given to him by the Chamber of Commerce,
in the Bourse, the Prince-President, emboldened by the mad
enthusiasm of the company present, suddenly cast off all reserve,
and unequivocally announced the impending change. “There
is one objection,” he urged in vindication of his purpose, “to
which I must reply. Certain minds seem to entertain a dread
of war; certain persons say, the Empire is only war. But I
say, <span class='sc'>the Empire is Peace</span> (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’Empire c’est la Paix</span>), for
France desires it, and when France is satisfied the world is
tranquil.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>JEFFERSON ON MARIE ANTOINETTE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Jefferson’s estimate of Marie Antoinette is not so favorable
as that of some writers; for many years after his return
from France he wrote of her thus:—</p>

<p class='c018'>This angel, as gaudily painted in the rhapsodies of Burke, with some
smartness of fancy, but no sound sense, was proud, disdainful of restraint,
indignant at all obstacles to her will, eager in the pursuit of pleasure, and
firm enough to hold to her desires, or perish in their wreck. Her inordinate
gambling and dissipations, with those of the Count d’Artois and others of
her <i>clique</i>, had been a sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, which
called into action the reforming hand of the nation; and her opposition to
it, her inflexible perverseness and dauntless spirit, led herself to the guillotine,
drew the king on with her, and plunged the world into crimes and
calamities which will forever stain the pages of modern history. I have
ever believed that had there been no queen there would have been no Revolution.
No force would have been provoked or exercised. [He adds, that
he would not have voted for the execution of the sovereign. He would
have shut the queen up in a convent, and deprived the king only of irresponsible
and arbitrary power.]</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GENERAL BLÜCHER.</h3>

<p class='c013'>This “personal” of Blücher is from the <cite>Recollections</cite> of
Lady Clementina Davies:—When the special messengers arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_795'>795</span>to inform Blücher that Napoleon had escaped from Elba, and
that his services would be immediately required in the field,
they were astonished to find him literally running round and
round a large room, the floor of which was covered with sawdust,
and in which he had immured himself under the delusion
that he was an elephant. For the time it was feared that
Blücher was hopelessly insane, or that he was so far suffering
from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">delirium tremens</span></i> that his active co-operation in the anticipated
campaign would be impossible; but when the urgent
news was brought him he at once recovered himself, and proceeded
to give his advice in a perfectly sound state of mind,
the tone of which was thus, as by a sudden shock, restored to
him.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE MOTHER OF CHARLES V.</h3>

<p class='c013'>An interesting historical discovery has been made by a Prussian
savant, of the name of Bergenroth, who was commissioned
by the English Government to investigate various collections of
Spanish archives for papers illustrating the relations between
Spain and England in the middle ages. Among other important
documents, M. Bergenroth discovered a hitherto unpublished
mass of correspondence of Ferdinand the Catholic and Charles

<p class='c000'>From this correspondence it appears that Joanna, daughter
of Ferdinand and Isabella, and mother of Charles, was not
really mad, as all the world has hitherto believed. The story
was an atrocious fabrication, under cover of which, first her
father, and then her son kept her incarcerated, in order to keep
possession themselves of the crown of Castile, which was hers
by right of her mother Isabella. After long years of rigorous
and even cruel captivity, the unfortunate lady did at last lose
her senses, but not until her old age.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are continually called upon to reconstruct our views of
history, which, the more we study it, more and more resembles
Hamlet’s cloud, taking whatever shape partisanship may determine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_796'>796</span>We must draw a new likeness of Charles, who is no
longer the prince full of Flemish <i>bonhomie</i>, good knight, and
boon companion, rigorous and despotic, but not personally cruel;
and when this is done, Philip II. will appear a less surprising
anomaly.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE TRADITIONAL MARY MAGDALENE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The injurious and probably unjust inferences respecting Mary
Magdalene, as drawn by the general assent of the Christian
Church from the narratives of the Evangelists, in which mention
is made of her attendance on our Lord, want the stamp of
confirmation. Such portraiture is more traditional than authoritative.
The prevailing conjecture that the infirmity of
which she had been cured implied moral guilt was rejected, or
mentioned with hesitation, by the early Greek and Latin
Fathers. It was taken up by Gregory the Great, and stamped
with his authority in the latter part of the sixth century. It
is sanctioned by the Roman Breviary, and its truth has been
assumed by most ecclesiastical writers, who seem to think that
Mary loved much because she had much to be forgiven. Painters
and poets have described the supposed illustrious penitent,
in loose array, without giving her costume the benefit of her
conversion! By these means it became established in the
popular mind. This was the more easy, as it supplied an
agreeable and interesting contrast. It made one Mary serve as
a foil to set off the excellencies of another. Mary, the mother
of our Lord, became the type of feminine purity; but the
leaders of opinion were not content with giving her those
honors to which all Christians consider her justly entitled. To
give it, however, the advantage of a striking contrast, and thus
make it shine with greater splendor, a female character of an
opposite description was wanted—a type of fallen womanhood,
penitent and restored. And as “the woman which was a sinner,”
mentioned by St. Luke in the seventh chapter of his Gospel, is
left by the historian strictly anonymous, Mary Magdalene,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_797'>797</span>whose name occurs in the next chapter, was seized on for this
purpose, and her character treated in a way which, by any
honest woman, would be deemed worse than martyrdom.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MOTHER GOOSE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Mother Goose, instead of being a traditional bard, or a creature
of fancy, as commonly supposed, was a veritable personage. The
mother-in-law of Thomas Fleet, the editor, in 1731, of the
Boston <cite>Weekly Rehearsal</cite>, was the original Mother Goose—the
“old woman” of the world-famous melodies. Mother Goose
belonged to a wealthy family in Boston, where her eldest
daughter, Elizabeth Goose, was married by Cotton Mather, in
1715, to Fleet, and in due time gave birth to a son. Like most
mothers-in-law in our own day, the importance of Mrs. Goose
increased with the appearance of her grandchild, and poor Mr.
Fleet, half distracted with her endless nursery ditties, finding
all other means fail, tried what ridicule could effect, and actually
printed a book with the title: “Songs for the Nursery, or
Mother Goose’s Melodies for Children, printed by T. Fleet, at
his printing house, Pudding Lane, Boston. Price ten coppers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mother Goose was the mother of nineteen children, and
hence we may easily trace the origin of that famous classic:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,</div>
      <div class='line'>She had so many children she didn’t know what to do.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>HISTORY AND FICTION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The archbishop of Canterbury once put the following question
to Betterton, the actor: “How is it that you players, who
deal only with things imaginary, affect your auditors as if they
were real; while we preachers, who deal only with things real,
affect our auditors as if they were imaginary?” “It is, my
lord,” replied the player, “because we actors speak of things
imaginary as if they were real, while you preachers too often
speak of things real as if they were imaginary.” Whitefield
used to tell this anecdote as an explanation of his own vehement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_798'>798</span>and dramatic style of preaching. The remark may be applied
to historical and fictitious writing. The old school historians
were so solid and stately that they conveyed only feeble images
to the mind, while poets and romancers out of airy nothings
have created living and breathing beings. How much more
readily we remember romance than history, and yet “truth is
stranger than fiction.” Shakspeare’s Macbeth and Richard are
not the Macbeth and Richard of history, yet we cling to the
poet’s portraits of them, and discard the sober truth. “Macbeth,”
Sir Walter Scott tells us, “broke no law of hospitality in
his attempt on Duncan’s life. He attacked and slew the king
at a place called Bothgowan, or the Smith’s house, near Elgin,
in 1039, and not, as has been supposed, in his own castle of
Inverness. The act was bloody, as was the complexion of the
times; but in very truth, the claim of Macbeth to the throne,
according to the rules of Scottish succession, was better than
that of Duncan. As a king, the tyrant so much exclaimed
against, was, in realty, a firm, just and equitable prince. Early
authorities show us no such persons as Banquo and his son
Fleance, nor have we reason to think that the latter ever fled
further from Macbeth than across the flat scene according to
the stage direction. Neither were Banquo or his son ancestors
of the house of Stuart. All these things are now known, but
the mind retains pertinaciously the impressions made by the
imposition of genius. While the works of Shakspeare are
read, and the English language exists, history may say what
she will, but the general reader will only recollect Macbeth as
the sacrilegious usurper and Richard as the deformed murderer.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CONTEMPORARY CRITICISM.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Robert Greene, the Elizabethan dramatist and novelist, indulged
in the following disparaging criticism in reference to
Shakspeare:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is an upstart crow beautified with our feathers that,
with his <i>tiger’s heart wrapt in a player’s hide</i>, supposes he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_799'>799</span>as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you,
and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit
the only Shake-scene in a country.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The line in italics is a parody of one in 3 Henry VI., i. 4:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“O! tiger’s heart wrapped in a woman’s hide,” which was
taken from an old play called the <cite>First Part of the Contention
of the two famous Houses of York and Lancaster</cite>. Shakspeare
is known to have founded his Henry VI. upon this
piece and another which are supposed to have been written by
Greene or his friends, and hence, no doubt, Greene’s acrimonious
remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>Says Dugald Stewart in his <cite>Essays</cite>:—A curious specimen of
cotemporary criticism is found in the Letters of the celebrated
Waller, who speaks thus of the first appearance of <cite>Paradise
Lost</cite>:—“The old blind schoolmaster, John Milton, hath published
a tedious poem on the Fall of Man. If its length be
not considered as merit, it has no other!” Johnson also says,
in his <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>: “Thompson has lately published a
poem, called the <cite>Castle of Indolence</cite>, in which there are some
good stanzas!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Why do not men of superior talents strive, for the honor of
the arts which they love, to conceal their ignoble jealousies from
the malignity of those whom incapacity and mortified pride
have leagued together as the covenanted foes of worth and
genius? What a triumph has been furnished to the writers
who delight in levelling all the proud distinctions of humanity!
and what a stain has been left on some of the fairest pages of
our literary history by the irritable passions and petty hostilities
of Pope and Addison!</p>

<p class='c000'>Michelet, the historian, showed his extreme aversion to the
First Napoleon by describing him as “without eyelashes or eyebrows;
with a small quantity of hair of an uncertain brown;
with eyes gray, like a pane of glass, wherein one sees nothing;
in short, an incomplete and obscure impersonality which appears
phantasmagorical.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>GREAT EVENTS FROM LITTLE CAUSES.</h3>

parvis momentis magnus rerum mutationes efficit.</span>—<span class='sc'>Cæsar</span>, <cite>De Bello Civili</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Poor Richard’s Almanac</cite>, 1758, Franklin quotes,—“He
adviseth to circumspection and care even in the smallest matters,
because sometimes ‘A little neglect may breed great mischief,’
adding, ‘For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of a
shoe the horse was lost; for want of a horse the rider was lost’;
being overtaken and slain by the enemy, all for want of care
about a horse-shoe nail.” And St. James (ch. iii. v. 5) gives a
fine illustration in respect to the government of the tongue,
“Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the relations of cause and consequence there must, of
course, be many greater causes in readiness to act. An accidental
spark may blow up a fortress—<i>provided</i> there be gunpowder
in the magazine. But it is as legitimate as it is curious to trace
the successive links of a chain of events back to small accidents.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How momentous,” says Campbell, “are the results of
apparently trivial circumstances! When Mahomet was flying
from his enemies, he took refuge in a cave; which his pursuers
would have entered, if they had not seen a spider’s web at the
entrance. Not knowing that it was freshly woven, they passed
by, and thus a spider’s web changed the history of the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Louis VII., to obey the injunctions of his bishops,
cropped his hair and shaved his beard, Eleanor, his consort,
found him, with this unusual appearance, very ridiculous, and
soon very contemptible. She revenged herself as she thought
proper, and the poor shaved king obtained a divorce. She then
married the Count of Anjou, afterwards Henry II. of England.
She had for her marriage-dower the rich provinces of Poitou and
Guienne; and this was the origin of those wars which for three
hundred years ravaged France, and cost the French three
millions of men. All this probably had never occurred had
Louis not been so rash as to crop his head, and shave his beard,
by which he became so disgustful in the eyes of Queen Eleanor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_801'>801</span>Warton mentions, in his <cite>Notes on Pope</cite>, that the Treaty of
Utrecht was occasioned by a quarrel between the Duchess of
Marlborough and Queen Anne about a pair of gloves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expedition to the island of Ré was undertaken to gratify
a foolish and romantic passion of the Duke of Buckingham.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coquetry of the daughter of Count Julian introduced
the Saracens into Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>What can be imagined more trivial, remarks Hume, in one of
his essays, than the difference between one color of livery and
another in horse races? Yet this difference begat two most
inveterate factions in the Greek empire, the Prasini and

that unhappy government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The murder of Cæsar in the capitol was chiefly owing to his
not rising from his seat when the senate tendered him some

<p class='c000'>The negotiations with the Pope for dissolving Henry VIII.’s
marriage (which brought on the Reformation) are said to have
been interrupted by the Earl of Wiltshire’s dog biting his holiness’s
toe, when he put it out to be kissed by that ambassador;
and the Duchess of Marlborough’s spilling a basin of water on
Mrs. Masham’s gown, in Queen Anne’s reign, brought in the
Tory Ministry, and gave a new turn to the affairs of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the nose of Cleopatra had been shorter, said Pascal, in his

<p class='c000'>Luther might have been a lawyer, had his friend and companion
escaped the thunderstorm; Scotland had wanted her
stern reformer, if the appeal of the preacher had not startled him
in the chapel of St Andrew’s Castle; and if Mr. Grenville had
not carried, in 1764, his memorable resolution as to the expediency
of charging certain stamp duties on the plantations in
America, the western world might still have bowed to the
British sceptre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Giotto, one of the early Florentine painters, might have continued

<h4 class='c016'>THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Jefferson used to relate, with much merriment, that the
final signing of the Declaration of Independence was hastened
by an absurdly trivial cause. Near the hall in which the
debates were then held was a livery stable, from which swarms
of flies came into the open windows and assailed the silk-stockinged
legs of honorable members. Handkerchief in hand they
lashed the flies with such vigor as they could command on a
July afternoon, but the annoyance became at length so extreme
as to render them impatient of delay, and they made haste to
bring the momentous business to a conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>After such a long and severe strain upon their minds, members
seem to have indulged in many a jocular observation as
they stood around the table. Tradition has it that when John
Hancock had affixed his magnificent signature to the paper, he
said, “There, John Bull may read my name without spectacles!”
Tradition, also, will never relinquish the pleasure of
repeating that, when Mr. Hancock reminded members of the
necessity of hanging together, Dr. Franklin was ready with his
“Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or else, most assuredly
we shall all hang separately.” And this may have suggested to
the portly Harrison—a “luxurious, heavy gentleman,” as John
Adams describes him—his remark to slender Elbridge Gerry,
that when the hanging came he should have the advantage, for
poor Gerry would be kicking in the air long after it was all
over with himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>French critics censure Shakspeare for mingling buffoonery
with scenes of the deepest tragic interest. But here we find
one of the most important assemblies ever convened, at the
supreme moment of its existence, while performing the act that
gives it its rank among deliberate bodies, cracking jokes, and
hurrying up to the table to sign, in order to escape the flies. It
is precisely so that Shakspeare would have imagined the scene.</p>

  <h4 class='c016'>THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>According to a Spanish tradition the discovery of America
is mainly due to the result of a hard-fought game of chess.
Columbus had for seven weary years been dancing attendance
upon the Court of Spain in pursuance of the aim of his life.
The anxious petitioner for royal favor and assistance had failed
to arouse in Ferdinand sufficient interest, in what was declared
by the commissioners appointed to report upon the project, to
be a visionary and impracticable scheme. True, he had enlisted
the sympathy of the good queen Isabella, and his hopes had
been encouraged and sustained by her in many ways. But after
years of vain solicitation, baffled by the skepticism which could
not share his aspirations, he determined to lay his plans before
Charles VIII. of France, and accordingly called to take leave
of their majesties before his departure from Cordova. Arriving
at the palace at nightfall, he announced his purpose to the
queen, who instantly sought Ferdinand with a determination to
make a final effort on behalf of the sad and discouraged suitor.
The king was absorbed in a game of chess with a grandee whose
skill taxed his powers to the utmost. Isabella’s interruption had
the effect of distracting the monarch’s attention, and of causing
him to lose his principal piece, which was followed by a volley
of imprecations on mariners in general, and Columbus in particular.
The game grew worse, and defeat seemed imminent.
With the prospect of being vanquished, Ferdinand at length
told the queen that her <i>protegé</i> should be successful or otherwise
accordingly as the game resulted. She immediately bent
all her energies upon the board, and watched the long contest
with concentrated interest. The courtiers clustered around the
table, amused at the excitement of the king and the quiet
satisfaction of his antagonist. And so the game went on which
was to decide the discovery of a new world, until Isabella
leaned toward her husband’s ear and whispered, “you can
checkmate him in four moves.” In the utmost astonishment
Ferdinand re-examined the game, found the queen’s assertion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_804'>804</span>correct, and in the course of a few minutes announced that
Columbus should depart on his voyage with the title of Admiral
of the Elect.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE STORY OF TWO FAVORITE BALLADS.</h3>

<h4 class='c016'>ANNIE LAURIE.</h4>

<p class='c013'>The birth of the heroine of the well-known ballad of Annie
Laurie is quaintly recorded by her father, Sir Robert Laurie,
of Maxwelltown, in the family register, in these words:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“At the pleasure of the Almighty God, my daughter, Annie
Laurie, was born on the 16th day of December, 1682 years,
about 6 o’clock in the morning, and was baptised by Mr. Geo.”
[Hunter, of Glencairn.]</p>

<p class='c000'>And his own marriage is given in the same quaint style:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“At the pleasure of the Almighty, I was married to my
wife, Jean Riddle, upon the 27th day of July, 1674, in the
Tron<a id='t804'></a> Kirk of Edinb., by Mr. Annane.”</p>

<p class='c000'>These statements are derived from the curious collection of
manuscripts left by the late Mr. W. F. H. Arundell, of Barjarg
Tower, Dumfriesshire. The papers of this industrious collector
contain a vast fund of information respecting the antiquities and
county families of Dumfriesshire. From them we learn further
that Annie was wooed by William Douglas, of Fingland, in
Kirkcudbrightshire. Her charms are thus spoken of in his
pathetic lyric, “Bonnie Annie Laurie”:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Her brow is like the snow-drift,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her neck is like the swan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her face it is the fairest</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That e’er the sun shone on,</div>
      <div class='line'>That e’er the sun shone on,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And dark blue is her eye;</div>
      <div class='line'>And for bonnie Annie Laurie</div>
      <div class='line in2'>I’d lay me down and die.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“She was, however, obdurate to his passionate appeal, preferring
Alexander Ferguson, of Craigdarroch, to whom she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_805'>805</span>eventually married. This William Douglas was said to have
been the hero of the well-known song, “Willie was a Wanton
Wag.” Though he was refused by Annie, he did not pine
away in single blessedness, but made a runaway marriage with
Miss Elizabeth Clark, of Glenboig, in Galloway, by whom he
had four sons and two daughters.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'>ROBIN ADAIR.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Robin Adair was well-known in the London fashionable circles
of the last century by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i> of the “Fortunate
Irishman;” but his parentage and the exact place of his birth
are unknown. He was brought up as a surgeon, but “his detection
in an early amour drove him precipitately from Dublin,” to
push his fortunes in England. Scarcely had he crossed the
Channel when the chain of lucky events that ultimately led him
to fame and fortune commenced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near Holyhead, perceiving a carriage overturned, he ran to
render assistance. The sole occupant of this vehicle was a “lady
of fashion, well-known in polite circles,” who received Adair’s
attentions with thanks; and, being lightly hurt, and hearing
that he was a surgeon, requested him to travel with her in her
carriage to London. On their arrival in the metropolis she
presented him with a fee of one hundred guineas, and gave him
a general invitation to her house. In after life Adair used to
say that it was not so much the amount of this fee, but the
time it was given, that was of service to him, as he was then
almost destitute. But the invitation to her house was a still
greater service, for there he met the person who decided his
fate in life. This was Lady Caroline Keppel, daughter of the
second Earl of Albemarle and of Lady Anne Lenox, daughter
of the first Duke of Richmond. Forgetting her high lineage,
Lady Caroline, at the first sight of the Irish surgeon, fell desperately
in love with him; and her emotions were so sudden and
so violent as to attract the general attention of the company.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adair, perceiving his advantage, lost no time in pursuing it;
while the Albemarle and Richmond families were dismayed at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_806'>806</span>the prospect of such a terrible <i>mesalliance</i>. Every means
were tried to induce the young lady to alter her mind, but
without effect. Adair’s biographer tells us that “amusements,
a long journey, an advantageous offer, and other common modes
of shaking off what was considered by the family as an improper
match, were already tried, but in vain; the health of
Lady Caroline was evidently impaired, and the family at last
confessed, with a good sense that reflects honor on their understandings
as well as their hearts, that it was possible to prevent,
but never to dissolve an attachment; and that marriage was
the honorable, and indeed the only alternative that could secure
her happiness and life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Lady Caroline was taken by her friends from London
to Bath, that she might be separated from her lover, she
wrote, it is said, the song of “Robin Adair,” and set it to a
plaintive Irish tune that she had heard him sing. Whether written
by Lady Caroline or not, the song is simply expressive of her
feelings at the time, and as it completely corroborates the circumstances
just related, which were the town-talk of the period,
though now little more than family tradition, there can be no
doubt that they were the origin of the song, the words of
which, as originally written, are the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What’s this dull town to me?</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin’s not near;</div>
      <div class='line'>He whom I wish to see,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Wish for to hear.</div>
      <div class='line'>Where’s all the joy and mirth,</div>
      <div class='line'>Made life a heaven on earth?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! they’re all fled with thee,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin Adair!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What made the assembly shine?</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin Adair!</div>
      <div class='line'>What made the ball so fine?</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin was there!</div>
      <div class='line'>What, when the play was o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>What made my heart so sore?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! it was parting with</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin Adair!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_807'>807</span>But now thou art far from me,</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin Adair!</div>
      <div class='line'>But now I never see</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin Adair!</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet he I love so well</div>
      <div class='line'>Still in my heart shall dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! can I ne’er forget</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Robin Adair!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Immediately after his marriage with Lady Caroline, Adair
was appointed Inspector General of Military Hospitals, and subsequently,
becoming a favorite of George III., he was made Surgeon-General,
King’s Sergeant Surgeon, and Surgeon of Chelsea
Hospital. Very fortunate men have seldom many friends, but
Adair, by declining a baronetcy that was offered to him by the
king, for surgical attendance on the Duke of Gloucester, actually
acquired considerable popularity before his death, which
took place when he was nearly fourscore years of age, in 1790.
In the “Gentleman’s Magazine” of that year there are verses
“On the Death of Robert Adair, Esq., late Surgeon-General, by
J. Crane, M. D.,” who, it is to be hoped, was a much better
physician than a poet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lady Caroline Adair’s married life was short but happy.
She died of consumption, after giving birth to three children,
one of them a son. On her death-bed she requested Adair
to wear mourning for her as long as he lived; which he scrupulously
did, save on the king’s and queen’s birthdays, when his
duty to his sovereign required him to appear at Court in full
dress. If this injunction respecting mourning were to prevent
Adair marrying again, it had the desired effect; he did not marry
a second time, though he had many offers.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>JOAN OF ARC.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The legend respecting the substitution of another person at the
stake, and the subsequent marriage of the Maid to Robert des
Hermoises, has been treated by no less an iconoclast than M.
Octave Delepierre, the learned Belgian Consul in England, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_808'>808</span>volume (<cite>Doute Historique</cite>), privately printed. In the <cite>Athenæum</cite>
for September 15, 1855, there is a complete analysis of
the story, from which it appears that more than two centuries
after the alleged execution of Joan, namely in 1645, Father
Vignier found documents among the archives at Metz, which
spoke of the presence and recognition of Joan in that city, five
years after her alleged execution. The Father was then a
guest of a descendant of Robert des Hermoises, in whose muniment
chest he discovered the marriage contract of Robert and
Joan. The matter was forgotten, when in 1740, documents
were found at Orleans which recorded, among other things, a
gratuity made to Joan in 1439, “for services rendered by her
at the siege of the same city, 210 livres.” The tradition has
many singular points, and is full of delightful uncertainty.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AMY ROBSART.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Another time-honored illusion is gone, and Amy Robsart
descends into the grave like a respectable lady, instead of disappearing
through a trap-door into a vault beneath and breaking
her neck. So one by one the pleasant fictions over which
in youth we lingered with such keen enjoyment, are stripped
of their reality, and nothing but dull prose is left in their
place. The pretty legend of Pocahontas, the venerable and
patriotic one of William Tell, the ingenious mystification
between the island of Juan Fernandez, Alexander Selkirk,
and Robinson Crusoe, all have been cast down from their
shrines. Nay, attempts have been made to remove Shakspeare
himself into the region of myth, by representing that
Lord Bacon was the veritable author of the plays and poems
supposed to have been written by the great bard of Avon.
No one need now despair of the disappearance of any time-honored
personage or romance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The name of Amy Robsart has always possessed a peculiar
interest, not merely on account of the historical associations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_809'>809</span>connected with her, but for the halo with which romance and
poetry have invested her; and not the least strange feature of
the case is the fact that historians should have so generally ignored
the falsity of the legend. It had lain wrapped in its
venerable mantle for more than three hundred years, until very
recently, when public attention was forcibly called to the subject
by an article published in the Oxford <cite>Undergraduates’
Journal</cite>, England. In a communication in that periodical,
from the Secretary to the Oxford Architectural and Historical
Society, there is a statement to the following effect: “The Rev.
J. Burgon, the Vicar of St. Mary’s (Oxford), has caused an
inscription to be cut on the top step of the three steps leading
to the chancel of St. Mary’s Church, commemorating the site
of the interment of the ill-fated Amy Robsart. The inscription
is as follows: ‘In a vault of brick, at the upper end of
this quire, was buried Amy Robsart, wife of Lord Robert
Dudley, K. G., Sunday, 22d September, A. D. 1560.’” History
tells us that the funeral was celebrated with great pomp:
but previously to the ceremony, a coroner’s inquest was held on
the body, and after a long and minute investigation of the circumstances,
a verdict of “accidental death,” was returned.
The character of the Earl of Leicester, (Lord Robert Dudley)
her husband, was such as to raise grave doubts as to the mode
by which she came by her death, and the popular belief that
Queen Elizabeth was in love with him, and was willing to
marry him, gave great countenance to the prevailing suspicion
that he had kept his marriage a secret, and got rid of his wife
to enable him to carry out his ambitious schemes. The historian,
Hume, alludes to these reports, which, however, he derived
from Camden, the antiquary, and which very probably
originated in the political hostility and personal hatred of
Cecil, Walsingham, and others of Leicester’s mortal enemies.
Ashmole, in his work, <cite>The Antiquities of Berkshire</cite> gives
the popular legend from which Sir Walter Scott derived many
of the materials for his beautiful romance of <cite>Kenilworth</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_810'>810</span>Ashmole wrote his book about the middle of the seventeenth
century, a hundred years after the fatal event at Cumnor Hall;
he is, therefore, no authority on the subject; but William
Julius Mickle, the poet, took him for one a century later, and
turned the story into verse. And thus, between political hostility,
personal dislike, the non-authenticated statements of
historians, antiquaries, poets and novelists, it has long been
accepted as an undoubted fact that Robert Dudley, Earl of
Leicester, murdered his wife, or was accessory to her murder,
at Cumnor Hall. But it has been very generally overlooked
that his alleged main motive for the supposed murder could
have had no existence. There is no doubt the Queen knew he
was married, but she continued to disgrace herself by open
professions of attachment to him notwithstanding; and after
Amy’s sudden death, the inquest on her body, and her public
funeral, “Good Queen Bess” was just as fond of him as ever,
and showered such favors upon him as could have left him but
little to wish for. He knew perfectly well that a marriage
between himself and Elizabeth would have convulsed the
kingdom, and probably cost him his life. He also knew that
she had no real intention of parting with one iota of the royal
power or prerogative, even to him, and hence the motive for
the so-called murder falls to the ground, and with it the pathetic
romance built upon it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WILLIAM TELL.</h3>

<p class='c013'>William Tell is very hard to kill. German writers in the last
century demolish him, over and over again, but to little purpose.
He remained the Swiss hero, and what is far worse, those
hideous statues at Altorf continue to assert their undying ugliness,
and pretend to prove, by their presence there, the truth
of the story. The giant has been recently slain once more as
an impostor. Once more? Half a dozen times; and each slayer
takes himself for the sole and original champion. Swiss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_811'>811</span>professors even have been at the work of demolition. Three or
four years ago Mr. Baring-Gould, in his “Curious Myths of the
Middle Ages,” set up a dozen of those myths, and bowled them
all down at one bowl: he proved, as others had done, that the
legend of William Tell was “as fabulous as any other historical
event.” Mr. Baring-Gould, however, does more than some
others have done. He traces the story as far back as it can be
traced. This is the order of the tradition:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. In the tenth century a tippling, boasting Danish soldier,
named Toki, swore he could drive an arrow through an apple,
placed on the point of a stick, at a great distance. King Harald
Bluetooth told the boaster that the apple should be placed on his
son’s head, and if Toki did not send an arrow through it at the
first attempt, his own head should pay the penalty. Toki performed
the feat with perfect success; but Harald perceiving
he had brought other arrows, demanded the reason thereof, and
Toki replied that if he had injured his son he would have driven
those other arrows into the King’s body. The story was first
related by Saxo Grammaticus, in the twelfth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. But in the eleventh century the above prototype of Tell
had successors or imitators. King Olaf, the Saint of Norway,
challenged Eindridi, among other things, to shoot with an arrow
at a writing tablet on the head of Eindridi’s son. Each was to
have one shot. Olaf grazed the boy’s head, whereupon the boy’s
mother interfered, and Eindridi was withdrawn from the contest.
Olaf remarked that his competitor had a second arrow, which
Eindridi confessed that he intended for his Majesty if anything
very unpleasant had happened to the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. A year or two later in this eleventh century, another
Norse archer, Hemingr, had a match with King Harold. Harold
set a spear-shaft for a mark in the ground. He then fired in
the air; the arrow turned in its descent and pierced the spear-shaft.
Hemingr followed suit, and split the King’s arrow,
which was perpendicularly fixed in the spear-shaft. Then the
King stuck a knife in an oak. His arrow went into the haft.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_812'>812</span>Hemingr shot, and his arrow cleft the haft and went into the
socket of the blade. The enraged King next fired at a tender
twig, which his arrow pierced, but Hemingr’s split a hazel-nut
growing upon it. “You shall put the nut on your brother
Bjorn’s head,” said Harold, “and if you do not pierce it with
your spear at the first attempt, your life shall be forfeited.” Of
course the thing was done. Hemingr is supposed to have had
his revenge by sending an arrow through Harold’s trachea at
the battle of Stamford Bridge, where he fought on the English
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. In the Faroe Isles, the above Harold is said to have had
a swimming-match with a certain Geyti, who not only beat him,
but gave him a ducking. Harold condemned him to shoot a
hazel-nut off his brother’s head, under the usual penalty, and
with the usual result.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The same story is told of one Puncher, (suggestive name,)
with this difference, that the object aimed at was a coin.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. In Finland, it is a son who shoots an apple off his father’s
head; for which feat some robbers, who had captured his sire,
gave him up to the son.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. In a Persian poem of the twelfth century, a King, in
sport, shoots an arrow at an apple on the head of his favorite
page, who, though not hurt, died of the fright.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The story, with a difference, is told of Egil, in the Saga of
Thidrik, of no particular date.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. It is familiar to us, in the English ballad of William of
Cloudesley, chronological date of event uncertain.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Enter William Tell, in the first decade of the fourteenth
century. We need not tell his well-known tale again. It is only
necessary to remark, by way of comment, that the Tell and
Gesler legend was not set up till many years afterwards, and that
in no contemporary record is any mention made of either Tell,
Gesler, or the apple incident. No Vogt named Gesler ever exercised
authority for the Emperor in Switzerland; no family
bearing the name of Tell can be traced in any part of that country.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_813'>813</span>11, and lastly. The hero’s name was not Tell at all, but
M’Leod, and he came from Braemar. Mr. Baring-Gould has
quite overlooked him. Therefore is the new claimant’s story
here subjoined in order to make the roll of legends complete.
It is taken from <cite>The Braemar Highlands; their Tales, Traditions
and History</cite>, by Elizabeth Taylor. The King referred to
is Malcolm Canmore.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A young man named M’Leod had been hunting one day in
the royal forest. A favorite hound of the King’s having attacked
M’Leod, was killed by him. The King soon heard of the slaughter
of his favorite, and was exceedingly angry—so much so that
M’Leod was condemned to death. The gibbet was erected on
Craig Choinnich, <i>i.e.</i>, Kennoth’s Craig. As there was less of
justice than revenge in the sentence, little time was permitted
ere it was carried into execution. The prisoner was led out by
the north gate of the castle. The King, in great state, surrounded
by a crowd of his nobles, followed in procession. Sorrowing
crowds of the people came after, in wondering amazement. As
they moved slowly on, an incident occurred which arrested
universal attention. A woman with a child in her arms came
rushing through the crowd, and throwing herself before the
King, pleaded with him to spare her husband’s life, though it
should be at the expense of all they possessed. Her impassioned
entreaties were met with silence. Malcolm was not to be
moved from his purpose of death. Seeing that her efforts to
move the King were useless, she made her way to her husband,
and throwing her arms around him declared that she would not
leave him—she would go and die with him. Malcolm was somewhat
moved by the touching scene. Allen Durward, noticing the
favorable moment, ventured to put in the suggestion that it was a
pity to hang such a splendid archer. ‘A splendid archer, is he?’
replied the King; ‘then he shall have his skill tried.’ So he
ordered that M’Leod’s wife and child should be placed on the
opposite side of the river; something to serve as a mark was to
be placed on the child’s head. If M’Leod succeeded in hitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_814'>814</span>the mark without injuring his wife or child his life would be
spared, otherwise the sentence was to be carried into execution.
Accordingly (so the legend goes) the young wife and child were
put across the river, and placed on Tomghainmheine; according
to some, a little farther down the river, near where a boat-house
once stood. The width of the Dee was to be the distance separating
M’Leod from his mark. He asked for a bow and two arrows,
and having examined each with the greatest care, he took
his position. The eventful moment came, the people gathered
round him, and stood in profound silence. On the opposite
side of the river his wife stood, the central figure of a crowd
of eager bystanders, tears glistening on her cheeks as she gazed
alternately at her husband and child in dumb emotion. M’Leod
took aim; but his body shook like an aspen-leaf in the evening
breeze. This was a trial for him far harder than death. Again
he placed himself in position; but he trembled to such a degree
that he could not shoot, and turning to the King, who stood
near, he said in a voice scarcely articulate in its suppressed agony,
‘This is hard!’ But the King relented not; so the third time
he fell into the attitude, and as he did so, almost roared, ‘This
is hard!’ Then as if all his nervousness had escaped through the
cry, he let the arrow fly—it struck the mark! The mother seized
her child, and in a transport of joy seemed to devour it with
kisses; while the pent-up emotion of the crowd found vent
through a loud cry of wonder and triumph, which repeated itself
again and again as the echoes rolled slowly away among the
neighboring hills. The King now approached M’Leod, and
after confirming his pardon, inquired why he, so sure of hand
and keen of sight, had asked two arrows? ‘Because,’ replied
M’Leod, ‘had I missed the mark, or hurt my wife and child, I was
determined not to miss you.’ The king grew pale, and turned
away as if undecided what to do. His better nature prevailed;
so he again approached M’Leod, and with kindly voice and
manner told him that he would receive him into his body-guard,
and he would be well provided for. ‘Never!’ answered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_815'>815</span>undaunted Celt. ‘After the painful proof to which you have
just put my heart. I could never love you enough to serve you
faithfully. The King in amazement cried out, ‘Thou art a
Hardy! and as Hardy thou art, so Hardy thou shalt be.’” From
that time M’Leod went under the appellation of Hardy, while
his descendants were termed the M’Hardy’s—Mac being the
Gaelic word for son. The date of the above is the eleventh
century, when the legend burst forth in several parts of the
world. Here we have it in Scotland. Like many other legends
it probably came originally from India.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE TIME OF LE GRAND MONARQUE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Thackeray draws the following graphic picture of the extremes
of society in Europe in the time of Louis XIV. Rarely
is the contrast between “the boast of heraldry, the pomp of
power,” and “the short and simple annals of the poor,” delineated
with such masterly vigor. Referring to the influence
of French fashions upon the German courts, he says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>It is incalculable how much that royal bigwig cost Germany.
Every prince imitated the French king, and had his Versailles,
his Wilhelmshöhe or Ludwigslust; his court and its splendors;
his gardens laid out with statues; his fountains, and
water-works, and Tritons; his actors, and dancers, and singers,
and fiddlers; his harem, with its inhabitants; his diamonds and
duchies for these latter; his enormous festivities, his gaming-tables,
tournaments, masquerades, and banquets lasting a week
long, for which the people paid with their money, when the
poor wretches had it; with their bodies and very blood when
they had none; being sold in thousands by their lords and masters,
who gaily dealt in soldiers,—staked a regiment upon the
red at the gambling table; swapped a battalion against a dancing-girl’s
diamond necklace, and, as it were, pocketed their
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>As one views Europe, through contemporary books of travel,
in the early part of the last century, the landscape is awful—wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_816'>816</span>wastes, beggarly and plundered; half-burned cottages
and trembling peasants gathering piteous harvests; gangs
of such tramping along with bayonets behind them, and corporals
with canes and cats-of-nine-tails to flog them to barracks.
By these passes my lord’s gilt carriage, floundering through
the ruts, as he swears at the postillions, and toils on to the
Residenz. Hard by, but away from the noise and brawling of
the citizens and buyers, is Wilhelmslust or Ludwigsruhe, or Monbijou,
or Versailles—it scarcely matters which—near to the
city, shut out by woods from the beggared country, the enormous,
hideous, gilded, monstrous marble palace, where the
prince is, and the Court, and the trim gardens, and huge fountains,
and the forest where the ragged peasants are beating the
game in (it is death to them to touch a feather); and the jolly
hunt sweeps by with its uniform of crimson and gold; and
the prince gallops ahead puffing his royal horn; and his lords
and mistresses ride after him; and the stag is pulled down; and
the grand huntsman gives the knife in the midst of a chorus
of bugles; and ’tis time the court go home to dinner; and our
noble traveller, it may be the Baron of Pöllnitz, or the Count
de Königsmarck, or the excellent Chevalier de Seingalt, sees
the procession gleaming through the trim avenues of the wood,
and hastens to the inn, and sends his noble name to the marshal
of the court. Then our nobleman arrays himself in green
and gold, or pink and silver, in the richest Paris mode, and is
introduced by the chamberlain, and makes his bow to the jolly
prince, and the gracious princess; and is presented to the chief
lords and ladies, and then comes supper and a bank at Faro,
where he loses or wins a thousand pieces by daylight. If it
is a German court, you may add not a little drunkenness to
this picture of high life; but German, or French, or Spanish,
if you can see out of your palace-windows beyond the trim-cut
forest vistas, misery is lying outside; hunger is stalking about
the bare villages, listlessly following precarious husbandry;
ploughing stony fields with starved cattle; or fearfully taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_817'>817</span>in scanty harvests. Augustus is fat and jolly on his throne;
he can knock down an ox, and eat one almost; his mistress,
Aurora von Königsmarck, is the loveliest, the wittiest creature;
his diamonds are the biggest and most brilliant in the world,
and his feasts as splendid as those of Versailles. As for Louis
the Great, he is more than mortal. Lift up your glances respectfully,
and mark him eyeing Madame de Fontanges or
Madame de Montespan from under his sublime periwig, as he
passes through the great gallery where Villars and Vendome,
and Berwick, and Bossuet, and Massillon are waiting. Can
Court be more splendid; nobles and knights more gallant and
superb; ladies more lovely? A grander monarch, or a more
miserable starved wretch than the peasant his subject, you cannot
look on. Let us bear both these types in mind, if we wish
to estimate the old society properly. Remember the glory and
the chivalry? Yes! Remember the grace and beauty, the
splendor and lofty politeness; the gallant courtesy of Fontenoy
where the French line bids the gentlemen of the English
guard to fire first; the noble constancy of the old king and Villars
his general, who fits out the last army with the last crown-piece
from the treasury, and goes to meet the enemy and die
or conquer for France at Denain. But round all that royal
splendor lies a nation enslaved and ruined; there are people
robbed of their rights—communities laid waste—faith, justice,
commerce trampled upon, and well-nigh destroyed—nay, in
the very centre of royalty itself, what horrible stains and
meanness, crime and shame! It is but to a silly harlot that
some of the noblest gentlemen, and some of the proudest women
in the world are bowing down; it is the price of a miserable
province that the king ties in diamonds round his mistress’s
white neck. In the first half of the last century this
is going on all Europe over. Saxony is a waste as well as Picardy
or Artois; and Versailles is only larger and not worse
than Herrenhausen.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE BITER BIT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Jerry White, the Chaplain to Cromwell, carried his ambition
so far as to think of becoming son-in-law to his Highness,
by marrying his daughter, the lady Frances; and as Jerry had
those requisites that generally please the fair sex, he won the
affections of the young lady: but as nothing of this sort could
happen without the knowledge of the watchful father, who had
his spies in every place, and about every person, it soon reached
his ears. There were as weighty reasons for rejecting Jerry as
there had been for dismissing His Majesty Charles II., who had
been proposed by the Earl of Orrery as a husband. Oliver
therefore, ordered the informer to observe and watch them narrowly;
and promised that upon substantial proof of the truth of
what he had declared, he should be as amply rewarded as Jerry
severely punished. It was not long before the informer acquainted
his Highness that the Chaplain was then with the lady;
and upon hastening to his daughter’s apartment, he discovered
the unfortunate Jerry upon his knees, kissing her Ladyship’s
hand: seeing which, he hastily exclaimed, “What is the meaning
of this posture before my daughter Frances?” The Chaplain,
with great presence of mind, replied, “May it please your
Highness, I have a long time courted that young gentlewoman
there, my lady’s woman, and cannot prevail: I was therefore
humbly praying her Ladyship to intercede for me.” Oliver,
turning to the waiting-woman, said:—“What is the meaning of
this? He is my friend, and I expect you should treat him as
such:” who, desiring nothing more, replied, with a low courtesy,
“If Mr. White intends me that honor, I shall not oppose
him.” Upon which Oliver said, “We’ll call Goodwin: this
business shall be done presently, before I go out of the room.”
Jerry could not retreat. Goodwin came, and they were instantly
married,—the bride, at the same time, receiving £500
from the Protector.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Jerry White lived with this wife (not of his choice) more
than fifty years. Oldmixon says he knew both him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_819'>819</span>Mrs. White, and heard the story told when they were present;
at which time Mrs. White acknowledged “there was something
in it.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE LAST NIGHT OF THE GIRONDISTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Of all the prisons of Paris, the Conciergerie is the most interesting,
from its antiquity, associations, and mixed style of architecture,—uniting
as it were the horrors of the dungeons of the
Middle Ages with the more humane system of confinement of
the present century. It exhibits in its mongrel outline the progressive
ameliorations of humanity toward criminals and offenders,—forming
a connecting link between feudal barbarity and
modern civilization. Situated in the heart of old Paris, upon
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ile de la Cité</span>, separated from the Seine by the Quai de
l’Horologe, it is one of a cluster of edifices pregnant with souvenirs
of tragedy and romance. These buildings are the Sainte
Chapelle, the Prefecture de Police, and the Palais de Justice,
formerly the residence of the French monarchs. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conciergerie</span>,
which derives its name from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</span></i>, or keeper, was
anciently the prison of the palace. It is now chiefly used as
a place of detention for persons during their trial. Recent alterations
have greatly diminished the gloomy and forbidding effect
of its exterior; but sufficient of its old character remains to perpetuate
the associations connected with its former uses, and to
preserve for it its interest as a relic of feudalism. The names
of the two turrets flanking the gateway, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tour de César</span>, and
Tour Boubec, smack of antiquity. Compared with Cæsar, however,
its age is quite juvenile, being less than nine hundred years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest legible entry in the archives of the Conciergerie
is that of the regicide Ravaillac, who was incarcerated May 16,
1610. Among the memorable names on its register are those of
Damiens, who attempted the life of Louis XV.; Eleonore
Galigaï, the confidante of Marie de Medicis; La Voisine, the
famous female poisoner, who succeeded Madame de Brinvilliers;
Cartouche the noted robber, and high above them all in point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_820'>820</span>of tragic interest, the innocent and unfortunate queen, Marie
Antoinette.</p>

<p class='c000'>The records of this prison furnish extraordinary illustrations
of stoicism in the midst of civil calamity, and its walls bear witness
to almost inconceivable indifference to the mastery of violence.
We know that there is no social upheaval to which human
nature, with its versatility of powers for good or evil, may not
become accustomed, and if the condition be inevitable, even
become reconciled. But the conduct of the prisoners of the Conciergerie,
in many instances, tinged as it was with mingled sublimity
and folly, surpasses comprehension. During the Reign of
Terror they were almost daily decimated by the guillotine; yet
their constant <i>amusement</i> was to play at charades and the—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guillotine</span></i>.
Both sexes and all ranks assembled in one of the halls.
They formed a revolutionary tribunal—choosing accusers and
judges, and parodizing the gestures and voice of Fouquier Tinville
and his coadjutors. Defenders were named; the accused
were taken at hazard. The sentence of death followed close on the
heels of the accusation. They simulated the toilet of the condemned,
preparing the neck for the knife by feigning to cut the
hair and collar. The sentenced were attached to a chair reversed
to represent the guillotine. The knife was of wood, and as it
fell, the individual, male or female, thus sporting with their approaching
fate, tumbled down as if actually struck by the iron
blade. Often while engaged in this <i>play</i>, they were interrupted
by the terrible voice of the public crier, calling over the “names
of the brigands who to-day have gained the lottery of the holy
guillotine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But among the curious souvenirs of this celebrated jail, the
most memorable is that of the last night of the Girondists, that
unique festivity which was certainly the grandest triumph of philosophy
in the annals of human events. Those fierce, theoretical
deputies, who had so recently sent to the scaffold the King and
Queen of France, were now in turn on their way thither.
Christianity teaches men to live in peaceful humility, and to die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_821'>821</span>with hopeful resignation. The last hour of a true believer is
calmly joyous. Here was an opportunity for infidelity to assert
its superiority in death, as it had claimed for itself the greatest
good in life. Let us be just to even these deluded men. They
had played a terrible role in the history of their country, and
they resigned themselves to die with the same intrepidity with
which they had staked their existence upon the success of their
policy. They made it a death <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span>, each smiling as he awaited
the dread message, and devoting his latest moments to those
displays of intellectual rivalry which had so long united them
in life. Mainvielle, Ducos, Gensonné, and Boyer Foufréde
abandoned themselves to gayety, wit and revelry, repeating their
own verses with friendly rivalry, and stimulating their companions
to every species of infidel folly. Viger sang amorous songs;
Duprat related a tale; Gensonné repeated the Marseillaise;
while Vergniaud alternately electrified them with his eloquence,
or discoursed philosophically of their past history, and the unknown
future upon which they were about to enter. The discussion
on poetry, literature, and general topics, was animated
and brilliant; on God, religion, the immortality of the soul,
grave, eloquent, calm and poetic. The walls of the prison echoed
to a late hour in the morning to their patriotic cries, and were
witnesses to their fraternal embraces. The corpse of Valazé, the
only one of their number who by a voluntary death eluded the
scaffold, remained with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole scene was certainly the wildest and most dramatic
ever born of courage and reason. Yet throughout their enthusiasm
there appears a chill of uncertainty, and an intellectual coldness
that appals the conscience. We feel that for the Girondists
it was a consistent sacrifice to their theories and their lives;
but for a Christian and patriot, a sad and unedifying spectacle.</p>

<p class='c000'>While history cannot refute the tribute of admiration to high
qualities, even when misdirected, it is equally bound to record
the errors and repeat the warnings of those who claim a place
in its pages. The lives of the Girondists, as well as their deaths,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_822'>822</span>formed a confused drama of lofty aspirations, generous sentiments
and noble sacrifices, mingled with error, passion and folly.
Their character presents all the cold brilliancy of fireworks,
which excite our admiration only to be chilled with disappointment
at their speedy eclipse. Their death-scene was emphatically
a <i>spectacle</i>. It exhibited neither the simple grandeur of the
death of Socrates, nor the calm and trustful spirit that characterized
the dying moments of Washington; the one yielding up
his spirit as a heathen philosopher; the other dying as a Christian
statesman.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>QUEEN ELIZABETH AND THE RING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Concerning the love-token which Queen Elizabeth gave to
Essex, with an intimation that if he forfeited her favor, its return
would secure her forgiveness, Miss Strickland quotes the testimony
of Lady Spelman, who says that when Essex lay under
sentence of death, he determined to try the virtue of the ring,
by sending it to the queen, and claiming the benefit of her
promise; but knowing he was surrounded by the creatures of
those who where bent on taking his life, he was fearful of
trusting it to any of his attendants. At length, looking out of
his window, he saw early one morning a boy whose countenance
pleased him, and him he induced by a bribe to carry the ring,
which he threw down to him from above, to the Lady Scrope,
his cousin, who had taken so friendly interest in his fate. The
boy, by mistake, carried it to the Countess of Nottingham, the
cruel sister of the fair and gentle Scrope, and, as both these
ladies were of the royal bedchamber, the mistake might easily
occur. The countess carried the ring to her husband the Lord
Admiral, who was the deadly foe of Essex, and told him the
message, but he bade her suppress both. The queen, unconscious
of the accident, waited in the painful suspense of an angry lover
for the expected token to arrive; but not receiving it, she concluded
he was too proud to make this last appeal to her tenderness,
and, after having once revoked the warrant, she ordered
the execution to proceed.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>What a fine passage is that of Bishop <span class='sc'>Heber</span>, which is said
to have suggested to <span class='sc'>Cole</span> his justly-famed series of paintings,
entitled <cite>The Voyage of Life</cite>!</p>

<p class='c000'>Life bears us on like the stream of a mighty river. Our
boat at first glides swiftly down the narrow channel, through
the playful murmurings of the little brook and the windings
of its grassy borders: the trees shed their blossoms over our
young heads, and the flowers on the brink seem to offer themselves
to our young hands; we rejoice in hope, and grasp
eagerly at the beauties around us; but the stream hurries us
on, and still our hands are empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our course in youth and manhood is along a wider and
deeper flood, and amid objects more striking and magnificent.
We are animated by the moving picture of enjoyment and industry
that is passing before us; we are excited by some short-lived
success, or depressed and rendered miserable by some short-lived
disappointment. But our energy and dependence are
alike in vain. The stream bears us on, and our joys and griefs
are left behind us: we may be shipwrecked, but we cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_827'>827</span>anchor; our voyage may be hastened, but cannot be delayed;
whether rough or smooth, the river hastens toward its home;
the roaring of the waves is beneath our keel, the land lessens
from our eyes, the floods are lifted up around us, and we take
our last leave of earth and its inhabitants, and of our future
voyage there is no witness save the Infinite and the Eternal!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DR. FRANKLIN’S MORAL CODE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The great American philosopher and statesman, Benjamin
Franklin, drew up the following list of moral virtues, to which
he paid constant and earnest attention, and thereby made himself
a better and happier man:—</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Temperance.</i>—Eat not to fulness; drink not to elevation.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Silence.</i>—Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself;
avoid trifling conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Order.</i>—Let all your things have their places; let each part
of your business have its time.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_829'>829</span><i>Resolution.</i>—Resolve to perform what you ought; perform
without fail what you resolve.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Frugality.</i>—Make no expense, but do good to others as
yourself; that is, waste nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Industry.</i>—Lose no time, be always employed in something
useful; but avoid all unnecessary actions.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Sincerity.</i>—Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and
justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Justice.</i>—Wrong no one by doing injuries, or omitting the
benefits that are your duty.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Moderation.</i>—Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Cleanliness.</i>—Suffer no uncleanliness in body, clothes, or
habitation.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Tranquillity.</i>—Be not disturbed about trifles, or at accidents
common or unavoidable.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Humility.</i>—Imitate Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The celebrated Lord Coke wrote the subjoined couplet,
which he religiously observed in the distribution of time:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Six hours to sleep,—to law’s grave studies six,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Four spent in prayer,—the rest to nature fix.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But Sir William Jones, a wiser economist of the fleeting
hours of life, amended the sentence in the following lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Seven hours to law,—to soothing slumber seven,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Ten to the world allot,—and all to heaven.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c012'>LIVING LIFE OVER AGAIN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Good Sir Thomas Browne says, Though I think no man can
live well once but he that could live twice, yet for my own part
I would not live over my hours past, nor begin again the thread
of my days; not upon Cicero’s ground,—because I have lived
them well,—but for fear I should live them worse. I find my
growing judgment daily instruct me how to be better, but my
untamed affections and confirmed vitiosity make me daily do
worse. I find in my confirmed age the same sins I discovered
in my youth; I committed many then, because I was a child,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_830'>830</span>and because I commit them still, I am yet an infant. Therefore
I perceive a man may be twice a child before the days of
dotage, and stand in need of Æson’s bath before threescore.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>NICE QUESTIONS FOR LAWYERS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A gentleman, who died in Paris, left a legacy of $6000 to
his niece in Dubuque, Iowa, who it appears also died about the
same hour of the same day. The question which died first
turns upon the relation of solar to true time, and must be decided
by the difference of longitude. If the niece died at four
o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and her uncle at ten o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, the instants of
their death would have been identical. Assuming that to be
the hour of the testator’s death, if the niece died at any hour
between four and ten, although the legacy would apparently
revert to his estate, it would really vest in her and her heirs,
since by solar time she would have actually survived her
uncle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another case where great importance depended upon the precise
time of death was that of the late Earl Fitzhardinge, who
died “about midnight,” between October 10th and 11th. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_832'>832</span>rents, amounting to £40,000 a year, were payable on Old Lady-day
and Old Michaelmas-day. The latter fell this year (1857)
on Sunday, October 11, and the day began at midnight: so that
if he died before twelve, the rents belonged to the parties taking
the estate; but if after, they belonged to and formed part of his
personal estate. The difference of one minute might therefore
involve the question as to the title of £20,000.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>is well known—asked Rabbi Joshua Ben Hananiah, in the
course of an interview following the successful siege of Bitter,
“How doth a man revive again in the world to come?” He
answered and said, “From <i>Luz</i>, in the back-bone.” Saith he
to him, “Demonstrate this to me.” Then he took <i>Luz</i>, a little
bone out of the back-bone, and put it in water, and it was not
steeped; he put it into the fire, and it was not burned; he
brought it to the mill, and that could not grind it; he laid it
on the anvil and knocked it with a hammer, but the anvil was
cleft, and the hammer broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The name Luz is probably derived from Genesis xlviii. 3,
where, however, it refers to a place, not to a bone. The bone
alluded to is the <i>sacrum</i>, the terminal wedge of the vertebral
column. Butler, in his Hudibras, erroneously traces to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_833'>833</span>Rabbinic belief the modern name <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os sacrum</span></i>, its origin really

<h3 class='c012'>REMARKABLE TRANCE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>At the siege of Rouen, the body of François de Civille, a
French captain who was supposed to have been killed, was
thrown with others into the ditch, where it remained from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_836'>836</span>eleven o’clock in the morning to half-past six in the evening,
when his servant, observing some latent heat, carried the body
into the house. During the ensuing five days and nights not
the slightest sign of life was exhibited, although the body
gradually recovered its warmth. At the expiration of this
time the town was carried by assault, and the servants of an
officer belonging to the besiegers, having found the supposed
corpse of Civille, threw it out of a window, with no other covering
than his shirt. Fortunately for the captain, he fell upon
a heap of straw, where he remained senseless three days
longer, when he was taken up by his relations for sepulture
and ultimately brought to life. What was still more strange,
Civille, like Macduff, had been “from his mother’s womb
untimely ripped,” having been brought into the world by a
Cæsarian operation which his mother did not survive. After
his last escape he used to add to his signature, “three times
born, three times buried, and three times risen from the dead
by the grace of God.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Whether,—as in the case of the Abbé Prevost in the forest
of Chantilly,—if a supposed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cadaver</span></i>, while subjected to the investigating
knife of the anatomist, should awake from a trance
only to be conscious of his horrible condition and to expire
from the immediate effect of the dissection, it is any thing more
than homicide <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">per infortuniam</span></i>, or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether, in the case of Lazarus, who was restored to life by
the Saviour after decomposition had commenced, he could have
reclaimed property already in the possession and occupancy of
the heirs to whom he had willed it before death.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PRESERVED BODIES.</h3>

<p class='c013'>There is an arched vault, or burying-ground, under the
church at Kilsyth, in Scotland, which was the burying-place
of the family of Kilsyth until the estate was forfeited and
the title became extinct in the year 1715, since which it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_837'>837</span>never been used for that purpose except once. The last earl
fled with his family to Flanders, and, according to tradition, was
smothered to death about the year 1717, along with his lady
and an infant child, and a number of other unfortunate Scottish
exiles, by the falling in of the roof of a house in which they
were assembled. What became of the body of the earl is not
known; but the bodies of Lady Kilsyth and her infant were
disembowelled and embalmed, and soon afterwards sent over to
Scotland. They were landed, and lay at Leith for some time,
whence they were afterwards carried to Kilsyth, and buried
with great pomp, in the vault above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1796, some reckless young men, having paid
a visit to this ancient cemetery, tore open the coffin of Lady
Kilsyth and her infant. With astonishment and consternation
they saw the bodies of Lady Kilsyth and her child as perfect as
they had been the hour they were entombed. For some weeks
this circumstance was kept secret; but at last it began to be
whispered in several companies, and soon excited great and
general curiosity. “On the 12th of June,” wrote the minister
of the parish of Kilsyth, in a letter to Dr. Garnet, “when I was
from home, great crowds assembled, and would not be denied
admission. At all hours of the night, as well as the day, they
afterwards persisted in gratifying their curiosity. I saw the
body of Lady Kilsyth soon after the coffin was opened. It was
quite entire. Every feature and every limb was as full, nay, the
very shroud was as clear and fresh and the colors of the ribands
as bright, as the day they were lodged in the tomb. What rendered
this scene more striking and truly interesting was that the
body of her son and only child, the natural heir of the title and
estates of Kilsyth, lay at her knee. His features were as composed
as if he had been only asleep. His color was as fresh,
and his flesh as plump and full, as in the perfect glow of
health; the smile of infancy and innocence sat on his lips.
His shroud was not only entire, but perfectly clean, without a
particle of dust upon it. He seems to have been only a few
months old. The body of Lady Kilsyth was equally well preserved;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_838'>838</span>and at a little distance, from the feeble light of a taper,
it would not have been easy to distinguish whether she was
dead or alive. The features, nay, the very expression of her
countenance, were marked and distinct; and it was only in a
certain light that you could distinguish any thing like the agonizing
traits of a violent death. Not a single fold of her shroud
was decayed, nor a single member impaired. Neither of the
bodies appear to have undergone the slightest decomposition or
disorganization. Several medical gentlemen made incisions into
the arm of the infant, and found the substance of the body
quite firm, and in its original state.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer states, among other interesting points that attracted
his attention, that the bodies appeared to have been
saturated in some aromatic liquid, of the color of dark brandy,
with which the coffin had been filled, but which had nearly all
evaporated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other instances of the artificial preservation of bodies might
be mentioned, still more remarkable, though perhaps less interesting,
than the preceding. The tomb of Edward the First,
who died on the 7th of July, 1307, was opened on the 2d of
January, 1770, and after the lapse of four hundred and sixty-three
years the body was found undecayed: the flesh on the face
was a little wasted, but not decomposed. The body of Canute
the Dane, who obtained possession of England in the year
1017, was found quite fresh in the year 1766, by the workmen
repairing Winchester Cathedral. In the year 1522, the body
of William the Conqueror was found as entire as when first
buried, in the Abbey Church of St. Stephen at Caen; and the
body of Matilda his queen was found entire in 1502, in the
Abbey Church of the Holy Trinity in the same city.</p>

<p class='c000'>No device of art, however, for the preservation of the remains
of the dead, appears equal to the simple process of
plunging them into peat-moss.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a manuscript by one Abraham Grey, who lived about the
middle of the sixteenth century, now in the possession of his
representative Mr. Goodbehere Grey, of Old Mills, near Aberdeen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_839'>839</span>it is stated that, in 1569, three Roman soldiers, in the
dress of their country, fully equipped with warlike instruments,
were dug out of a moss of great extent, called Kazey Moss.
When found, after the lapse of probably about fifteen hundred
years, they were still fresh and plump!</p>

<p class='c000'>Modern chemistry teaches us that in these cases there is a
conversion of the tissues of the body into adipocere, a substance
closely resembling spermaceti, and composed, according
to Chevreul, of margaric and oleic acids, with a slight addition
of the alkalies. It is generally formed from bodies buried in
moist earth, and especially when they have accumulated in
great numbers. On the removal of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cimetière des Innocens</span></i>
in Paris, in 1787, where thousands of bodies had been buried
annually for several centuries, it was found that those bodies
which had been placed in great numbers in the trenches
were, without having lost their shapes, converted into this
substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Johnston, in alluding to the custom of converting

beautifully as truly:—</p>

<p class='c000'>Embalm the loved bodies, and swathe them, as the old
Egyptians did, in resinous cerements, and you but preserve
them a little longer, that some wretched, plundering Arab may
desecrate and scatter to the winds the residual dust. Or
jealously, in regal tombs and pyramids, preserve the forms of
venerated emperors or beauteous queens, still, some future conqueror,
or more humble Belzoni, will rifle the most secure resting-place.
Or bury them in most sacred places, beneath high
altars, a new reign shall dig them up and mingle them again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_840'>840</span>with the common earth. Or, more careful still, conceal your
last resting-place where local history keeps no record and even
tradition cannot betray you: then accident shall stumble at
length upon your unknown tomb and liberate your still remaining
ashes.</p>

<p class='c000'>How touching to behold the vain result of even the most
successful attempts at preserving apart, and in their relative
places, the solid materials of the individual form! The tomb,
after a lapse of time, is found and opened. The ghastly tenant
reclines, it may be, in full form and stature. The very features
are preserved,—impressed, and impressing the spectator, with
the calm dignity of their long repose. But some curious hand
touches the seemingly solid form, or a breath of air disturbs
the sleeping air around the full-proportioned body,—when, lo!
it crumbles instantly away into an almost insensible quantity
of impalpable dust!</p>

<p class='c000'>Who has not read with mingled wonder and awe of the opening,
in our own day, of the almost magical sepulchre of an
ancient Etruscan king? The antiquarian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">dilettanti</span></i>, in their
under-ground researches, unexpectedly stumbled upon the
unknown vault. Undisturbed through Roman and barbaric
times, accident revealed it to modern eyes. A small aperture,
made by chance in the outer wall, showed to the astonished
gazers a crowned king within, sitting on his chair of state,
with robes and sceptre all entire, and golden ornaments of ancient
device bestowed here and there around his person.
Eager to secure the precious spoil, a way is forced with hammer
and mattock into the mysterious chamber. But the long
spell is now broken; the magical image is now gone. Slowly,
as the vault first shook beneath the blows, the whole pageant
crumbled away. A light, smoky dust filled the air; and, where
the image so lately sat, only the tinselled fragments of thin
gold remained, to show that the vision and the ornaments had
been real, though the entire substance of the once noble form
had utterly vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few thousand years some apparently fortunate kings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_841'>841</span>and princes may arrest the natural circulation of a handful of
dust. But in what are they better than Cromwell, whose remains
were pitilessly disturbed,—than Wyckliffe, whose ashes
were sprinkled on the sea,—than St. Genevieve, whose remains
were burned in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place de Grève</span> and her ashes scattered to
the wind,—than Mausolus, whose dust was swallowed by his
wife Artemisia,—than the King of Edom, whose bones were
burned for lime,—or than St. Pepin and all the royal line of
Bourbon, whose tombs were emptied by a Parisian mob?
Lamartine tells us, in his <cite>History of the Girondists</cite>, that a decree
of the Convention had commanded the destruction of the
tombs of the kings at St. Denis. The Commune changed this
decree into an attack against the dead. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The axe
broke the gates of bronze presented by Charlemagne to the
Basilica of St. Denis. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* They raised the stones, ransacked
the vaults, violated the resting-places of the departed,
sought out, beneath the swathings and shrouds, embalmed
corpses, crumbled flesh, calcined bones, empty skulls of kings,
queens, princes, ministers, bishops. Pepin, the founder of the
Carlovingian dynasty and father of Charlemagne, was now <i>but
a pinch of gray ash, which was in a moment scattered by the
wind</i>. The mutilated heads of Turenne, Duguesclin, Louis
XII., Francis I., were rolled on the pavement. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
Beneath the choir were buried the princes and princesses of
the first race, and some of the third,—Hugh Capet, Philip
the Bold, Philip the Handsome. They rent away their rags
of silk and threw them on a bed of quicklime. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
They threw the carcass of Henry IV. into the common fosse.
His son and grandson, Louis XIII. and XIV., followed. Louis
XIII. was but a mummy; Louis XIV. a black, indistinguishable
mass of aromatics. Louis XV. came last out of his tomb. The
vault of the Bourbons rendered up its dead; queens, dauphinesses,
princesses, were carried away in armfuls by the workmen
and cast into the trench. A brief interval of proud separation,
and they were mingled with the common dust! Their
ashes dissipated, nothing but their empty tombs remain,—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_842'>842</span>houses of the dead, like the houses of the living, long surviving,
as melancholy mementos of the tenants for whom they
were erected.</p>

<p class='c000'>M. de Saulcy, in his <cite>Journey Round the Dead Sea</cite>, remarks
of the rock-tombs of the valley of Hinnom, “The immense
necropolis, traces of which are to be met with at every step in
the valley, dates from the period when the Jebusites were masters
of the country. After them the Israelites deposited the
remains of their fathers in the same grottoes; and the same
tombs, after having become at a still later period those of the
Christians who had obtained possession of the Holy City, have,
since the destruction of the Latin kingdoms of Jerusalem,
ceased to change both masters and occupants. Even the scattered
bones are no more found in them; and from the city
of the dead the dead alone have disappeared, while the abodes
are still entire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a barbaric philosophy, therefore, as well as an apparent
knowledge of the course of nature, in the treatment of the
dead which prevails in Thibet and on the slopes of the Himalaya.
In the former country the dead body is cut in pieces,
and either thrown into the lakes to feed the fishes, or exposed
on the hill-tops to the eagles and birds of prey. On the Himalayan
slopes the Sikkim burn the body and scatter the ashes
on the ground. The end is the same among these tribes of
men as among us. They briefly anticipate the usual course
of time,—a little sooner verifying the inspired words, “Dust
thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_844'>844</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>A STORY OF LONG AGO.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The long time ago of which I mean to tell, says Jean Ingelow,
was a wild night in March, during which, in a fisherman’s
hut ashore, sat a young girl at her spinning-wheel, and
looked out on the dark driving clouds, and listened, trembling,
to the winds and the seas. The morning light dawned at last.
One boat that should have been riding on the troubled waves
was missing—her father’s boat! and half a mile from the cottage
her father’s body was washed upon the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>This happened fifty years ago, and fifty years is a long time
in the life of a human being; fifty years is a long time to go
on in such a course as the woman did of whom I am speaking.
She watched her father’s body, according to the custom of her
people, till he was laid in the grave. Then she laid down on
her bed and slept, and by night got up and set a candle in her
casement, as a beacon to the fishermen and a guide. She sat
by the candle all night, and trimmed it, and spun; then when
the day dawned she went to bed and slept in the sunshine.
So many hanks as she spun before for her daily bread, she
spun still, and one over, to buy her nightly candle; and from
that time to this, for fifty years, through youth, maturity, and
old age, she turned night into day, and in the snow-storms
of Winter, through driving mists, deceptive moonlight, and
solemn darkness, that northern harbor has never once been
without the light of her candle.</p>

<p class='c000'>How many lives she saved by this candle, or how many
meals she won for the starving families of the boatmen, it is
impossible to say; how many a dark night the fishermen, depending
on it, went fearlessly forth, cannot now be told. There
it stood, regular as a light-house, and steady as constant care
could make it. Always brighter when daylight waned, they
had only to keep it constantly in view and they were safe; there
was but one thing that could intercept it, and that was the
rock. However far they might have stretched out to sea, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_845'>845</span>had only to bear down straight for that lighted window, and
they were sure of a safe entrance into the harbor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fifty years of life and labor—fifty years of sleeping in the
sunshine—fifty years of watching and self-denial, and all to
feed the flame and trim the wick of that one candle! But if
we look upon the recorded lives of great men and just men
and wise men, few of them can show fifty years of worthier,
certainly not of more successful labor. Little, indeed, of the
“midnight oil” consumed during the last half century so worthily
deserved trimming. Happy woman—and but for the
dreaded rock her great charity might never have been called
into exercise.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what do the boatmen and the boatmen’s wives think of
this? Do they pay the woman? No, they are very poor; but
poor or rich they know better than that. Do they thank her?
No. Perhaps they feel that thanks of theirs would be inadequate
to express their obligations, or, perhaps long years have
made the lighted casement so familiar that it is looked upon
as a matter of course. Sometimes the fishermen lay fish on
her threshold, and set a child to watch it for her till she
wakes; sometimes their wives steal into her cottage, now she
is getting old, and spin a hank or two of thread for her
while she slumbers; and they teach their children to pass her
hut quietly, and not to sing and shout before her door, lest
they should disturb her. That is all. Their thanks are not
looked for—scarcely supposed to be due. Their grateful
deeds are more than she expects and much as she desires.</p>

<p class='c000'>How often in the far distance of my English home, I have
awoke in a wild Winter night, and while the wind and storm
were arising, have thought of that northern bay, with the
waves dashing against the rock, and have pictured to myself
the casement, and the candle nursed by that bending, aged
figure! How delighted to know that through her untiring
charity the rock has long since lost more than half its terror,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_846'>846</span>and to consider that, curse though it may be to all besides, it
has most surely proved a blessing to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>You, too, may perhaps think with advantage on the character
of this woman, and contrast it with the mission of the rock.
There are many degrees between them. Few, like the rock,
stand up wholly to work ruin and destruction; few, like the
woman, “let their light shine” so brightly for good. But to
one of the many degrees between them we must all most certainly
belong—we all lean towards the woman or the rock.
On such characters you do well to speculate with me, for you
have not been cheated into sympathy with ideal shipwreck or
imaginary kindness. There is many a rock elsewhere as perilous
as the one I told you of—perhaps there are many such
women; but for this one, whose story is before you, pray that
her candle may burn a little longer, since this record of her
charity is true.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THIS IS NOT OUR HOME.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Among the beautiful thoughts which dropped like pearls
from the pen of that brilliant and talented journalist, George D.
Prentice, the following sublime extract upon man’s higher destiny
is perhaps the best known and most universally admitted.
Coming from such a source we can well appreciate it, for that
distinguished man had attained a position among his fellows
which would have satisfied almost any earthly ambition. Yet all
this could not recompense him for the toils and ills of life, and
in the eloquent passage subjoined he portrays, most beautifully,
the restless longings of the human heart for something higher
and nobler than earth can afford.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It cannot be that earth is man’s only abiding place. It cannot
be that our life is a bubble cast up by the ocean of eternity
to float a moment upon its waves and sink into nothingness.
Else, why these high and glorious aspirations which leap like
angels from the temple of our hearts, forever wandering unsatisfied?
Why is it that the rainbow and cloud come over us
with a beauty that is not of earth, and then pass off to leave us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_847'>847</span>to muse on their loveliness? Why is it the stars which hold their
festival around the midnight throne, are set above the grasp of
our limited faculties, forever mocking us with their unapproachable
glory? And, finally, why is it that the bright forms of
human beauty are presented to our view and taken from us,
leaving the thousand streams of our affections to flow back in
Alpine torrents upon our hearts? We were born for a higher
destiny than earth. There is a realm where the rainbow never
fades, where the stars will be spread out before us like the
islands that slumber on the ocean, and where the beautiful
beings that pass before us like shadows, will stay forever
in our presence.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ILL SUCCESS IN LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>One of our best American writers, Geo. S. Hillard, forcibly
and truly says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>I confess that increasing years bring with them an increasing
respect for men who do not succeed in life, as those words are
commonly used. Heaven is said to be a place for those who
have not succeeded on earth; and it is sure that celestial grace
does not thrive and bloom in the hot blaze of worldly prosperity.
Ill success sometimes arises from a superabundance of
qualities in themselves good—from a conscience too sensitive,
a taste too fastidious, a self-forgetfulness too romantic, and
modesty too retiring. I will not go so far as to say, with a living
poet, “that the world knows nothing of its great men,” but
there are forms of greatness, or at least excellence, which “die
and make no sign;” there are martyrs that miss the palm but
not the stake, heroes without the laurel, and conquerors without
the triumph.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FUTURITY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>“Life is sweet,” said Sir Anthony Kingston to Bishop
Hooper at the stake, “and death bitter.” “True, friend,” he
replied, “but consider that the death to come is more bitter,
and the life to come is more sweet.”</p>

<div>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE HEART.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In his charming <cite>Hyperion</cite>, Mr. Longfellow says:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The little I have seen of the world, and know of the history
of mankind, teaches me to look upon the errors of others in
sorrow, not in anger. When I take the history of one poor
heart that has sinned and suffered, and represent to myself the
struggles and temptations it has passed,—the brief pulsations
of joy,—the feverish inquietude of hope and fear,—the tears
of regret,—the feebleness of purpose,—the pressure of want,—the
desertion of friends,—the scorn of a world that has little
charity,—the desolation of the soul’s sanctuary,—threatening
voices within,—health gone,—happiness gone,—even hope, that
remains the longest, gone,—I would fain leave the erring
soul of my fellow-man with Him from whose hands it came,</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BEAUTIFUL THOUGHT.</h3>

<p class='c013'>On the shores of the Adriatic sea the wives of the fishermen,
whose husbands have gone far off upon the deep, are in
the habit, at even-tide, of going down to the sea-shore, and
singing, as female voices only can, the first stanza of a beautiful
hymn; after they have sung it they will listen till they hear,
borne by the wind across the desert sea, the second stanza sung
<span class='pageno' id='Page_849'>849</span>by their gallant husbands, as they are tossed by the gale upon
the waves, and both are happy. Perhaps, if we listen, we, too,
might hear on this desert world of ours some whisper borne
from afar to remind us that there is a heaven and a home; and
when we sing the hymn upon earth, perhaps we shall hear its
echo breaking in the music upon the sands of time, and cheering
the hearts of those that are pilgrims and strangers, and
look for a city that hath foundation.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LIFE’S PARTING.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Wordsworth read less and praised less the writings of other
poets, than any one of his contemporaries. This gives an especial
interest to the following stanza by Mrs. Barbauld, which
he learned by heart, and which he used to ask his sister to repeat
to him. Once, while walking in his sitting-room at Rydal,
with his hands behind him, his friend, Henry Crabb Robinson
heard him say: “I am not in the habit of grudging people
their good things; but I wish I had written those lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>Then steal away, give little warning,</div>

  <h3 class='c012'>DEATH’S FINAL CONQUEST.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c017'>[Among the poetic legacies that will “never grow old, nor change, nor
pass away,” is the noble dirge of Shirley, in his <cite>Contention of Ajax and
Ulysses</cite>. Doubtless it was by the fall, if not by the death, of Charles I.,
that the mind of the royalist poet was solemnized to the creation of these
imperishable stanzas. Oliver Cromwell is said, on the recital of them, to
have been seized with great terror and agitation of mind.]</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE COMMON HERITAGE.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There is no death: what seems so is transition:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>This life of mortal breath</div>
      <div class='line'>Is but a suburb of the life elysian</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whose portal we call Death.—<span class='sc'>Longfellow.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is—says the author of <cite>Euthanasy</cite>—no universal
night in this earth, and for us in the universe there is no
death. What to us here is night coming on, is, on the other
side of the earth, night ending, and day begun. And so what
we call death, the angels may regard as immortal birth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_852'>852</span>We are born—says another writer—with the principles of
dissolution in our frame, which continue to operate from our
birth to our death; so that in this sense we may be said to
“die daily.” Death is not so much a laying aside our old
bodies (for this we have been doing all our lives) as ceasing
to assume new ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Say,” said one who was about entering the Dark Valley, to
his amanuensis, “that I am still in the land of the living, but
expect soon to be numbered with the dead.” But, after a moment’s
reflection, he added, “Stop! say that I am still in the
land of the dying, but expect to be soon in the land of the
living.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Says old Jeremy Collier, The more we sink into the infirmities
of age, the nearer we are to immortal youth. All
people are young in the other world. That state is an eternal
spring, ever fresh and flourishing. Now, to pass from midnight
into noon on the sudden, to be decrepit one minute, and all
spirit and activity the next, must be an entertaining change.
To call this dying is an abuse of language.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day of our decease—says Mountford—will be that of
our coming of age; and with our last breath we shall become
free of the universe. And in some region of infinity, and from
among its splendors, this earth will be looked back upon like
a lowly home, and this life of ours be remembered like a short
apprenticeship to Duty.</p>

the smaller concerns of life, makes, as will be seen from the above caricature, a
very ludicrous appearance. A judicious imitation of his phraseology on trifling
subjects was a favorite manner of attack among the critics. Erskine’s
account of the Buxton baths is one of the most amusing. When several examples
of this sort were shown to Johnson, at Edinburgh, he pronounced that
of Lord Dreghorn the best: “but,” said he, “I could caricature my own
style much better myself.”</p>

5, 1859,) which is confirmed by Major Chotard, General Jackson’s Assistant
Adjutant-General:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“About twenty or twenty-five bales of cotton were used in forming the embrasures
of five or six batteries. There were four batteries of one piece of
artillery, or howitzer, and four of two pieces, established at different points
of the lines. Four bales were used at some of the batteries and six at others.
None were used in any other portions of the works, which consisted of breast-works
formed of earth thrown up from the inside, branches of trees, and rubbish.
Each company threw up its own breastwork; and the more it was
affected by the enemy’s artillery and Congreve rockets, the more industriously
the soldiers toiled to strengthen it.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
